<RD,ID:7:Chapter>Welcome to Folio
<RD,ID:8>Welcome to the Folio family of infobase software.
<RD,ID:9>Folio encompasses a suite of products and tools designed to help you get the most out of your electronic reference information.
<RD,ID:A>For information consumers, Folio Views provides features to help you find and use the information you need. Lightning fast searches, natural language syntax, and relevancy ranked search hits are but a few of the features to help you get to the information. Once you find what you need, you can use personalization tools such as electronic highlighters, bookmarks, and notes help you use that information.
<RD,ID:B>For information producers, Folio Builder provides the tools to get your legacy information into an infobase (the file format used by Folio Views) and provide the value-added features that help make the infobase accessible to those who use it. 
<RD,ID:C>Finally, for information publishers, Folio Publisher provides the software and license agreements you need to distribute your infobases commercially.
<RD,ID:D>These products, and the tools and applications which they contain, can help you find and use the wealth of information available to you. Rather than contributing to information overload, Folio products help you — as an individual, as a department, or as an organization — be more efficient and productive by providing scalable access to the information you need.
<RD,ID:E>As you get started with Folio, take a moment to read through the following frequently asked questions:<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Intro-Benefits of Folio 4">Why should I use Folio for my information needs?<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Intro-Infobase: A Definition">What exactly is an infobase?<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Intro-Getting Started with Folio 4">Where do I start?

<RD,ID:10:Heading><JD:"Intro-Benefits of Folio 4">The Benefits of Folio
<RD,ID:11>Everyday, we are inundated with information. Memos, e-mail, policy & procedure manuals, proceedings, quarterly reports, product documentation, and business cases are just a few of the sources that fill our in-boxes, hard drives, and networks with data that we need to keep for future study or reference. Unfortunately, finding the information you need is often a slow process — which file is it in and on which network drive? And once you find the file, where in the file is the specific information you need?
<RD,ID:12>Often, you simply give up trying to find the data and take your best guess at what you think the material contained. While this may be acceptable to you some of the time, it may not be acceptable to the customer you are talking to, or to the service rep who needs a procedure, or to the judge who prefers accurate citations in your motions and briefs.
<RD,ID:13>Folio helps you solve your information overload problems by providing the tools to:<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Rapidly search through gigabytes of information (stored in one or more infobase files) for the details you need.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Easily annotate that information for application-specific use.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Secure the information from unwanted changes or uses.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Track the use of the information.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Convert your existing information archives into the Folio infobase format.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Distribute your information to others within your company or commercially to other organizations who need the same type of information (such as legal cases or insurance standards).
<RD,ID:14>The Folio product line is divided into three primary products targeted at three different user groups:<HR><PS:"List 2"><FD:"Mac 4.11">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Intro-Benefits of Folio 4-Information Consumers">Information Consumers<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Intro-Benefits of Folio 4-Information Managers">Information Managers<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Intro-Benefits of Folio 4-Commercial Information Publishers">Commercial Information Publishers</FD:"Mac 4.11"><EL>
<RD,ID:15:"Sub-Heading 1"><JD:"Intro-Benefits of Folio 4-Information Consumers">Information Consumers
<RD,ID:16>If you primarily need to search and annotate information provided to you by others, such as your corporate policy & procedure manuals or historic case proceedings, then you need Folio Views.
<RD,ID:17>Folio Views is the award-winning software for electronic reference information consumption. Combining a powerful search engine which supports Boolean, wildcard, structured, and natural language searching with an intuitive interface, Folio Views helps you get your job done better and faster.
<RD,ID:18>With Folio Views, you can:<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB><CS:Emphasis>View infobases</CS><BD-> — Viewing infobases is the most basic task. Infobases can be any type of electronic reference information, including legal decisions, corporate policy and procedure manuals, common question archives, or any other data needed in an instant-access form.<HR><PS:"List 1"><BD>•<TB><CS:Emphasis>Search infobases</CS><BD-> — Instant search results is the strength of Folio Views. Folio Views is built around a robust search engine that allows for a variety of wildcards and operators, natural language parsing, fast phrase and proximity searching, and a ranked hit list. Whether you are looking for answers within one or several infobases, your answers are available as fast as you can ask for them.<HR><PS:"List 1"><BD>•<TB><CS:Emphasis>Annotate infobases</CS><BD-> — Once you have found the information you want, you may need a way to add value to it — to personalize it. Folio Views 4.x <BD>contains<BD-> a collection of annotation features which allow you to highlight sections of text, add margin notes, insert pop-up links, and create shadow files for annotating infobases on CD-ROM.<HR><PS:"List 1"><BD>•<TB><CS:Emphasis>Edit infobases</CS><BD-> — Ample editing features allow you to quickly add or update informatio<BD>n. In the fast-paced world of business, information often becomes obsolete in a matter of days. With this in mind, Folio has included <BD->several flexible editing features such as levels, paragraph and character styles, tables, hypertext links, and customized toolbars <BD>to<BD-> assist you in formatting the information you add to the infobase. All of these features, and more, are included in an intuitive, user-defined interface.<BD>
<RD,ID:19:"Sub-Heading 1"><JD:"Intro-Benefits of Folio 4-Information Managers">Information Managers
<RD,ID:1A>If you manage the information that others in your organization use, either as an IS manager, publications specialist, or team leader, then you need Folio Builder.
<RD,ID:1B>Folio Builder is an integrated tool set for getting existing information into an infobase and updating that information as necessary. If you have a large amount of legacy data, or if you want to create an automated process for converting your data into infobases, then Folio Builder will save you time and effort.
<RD,ID:1C>With Folio Builder, you can:<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB><CS:Emphasis>Convert Information to Infobases</CS> — A suite of customizable filters and tools help you get your information into an infobase quickly. When your information is converted, it is automatically indexed for rapid searching and compressed to reduce storage space requirements. Popular word processing formats such MS Word, WordPerfect, and FrameMaker, as well as RTF, HTML, and text are directly supported and can easily be converted to Folio infobases.
<RD,ID:1D><PS:"List 1">•<TB><CS:Emphasis>Validate Infobases and Source Files</CS> — The Folio validation tools help verify that your source files are correct before you create an infobase, saving both time and storage space. Verifying the infobase after it is created — or after it has been used for some time — assists you in keeping the file clean.
<RD,ID:1E><PS:"List 1">•<TB><CS:Emphasis>Secure Infobases</CS> — <BD->A complete security mechanism allows you to lock portions or all of an infobase, define what users may do while in the infobase, and specify how long users may access the infobase. This functionality gives confidence that your mission-critical data is secure and that subscription services can be maintained or enhanced.<BD>
<RD,ID:1F><PS:"List 1">•<TB><CS:Emphasis>Optimize Infobases</CS> — Before you send out an infobase, you should optimize it. Optimize puts the finishing touches on the infobase by compressing it to the smallest size possible and optimizing it for faster searches.
<RD,ID:20><PS:"List 1">Folio Builder includes Folio Views.
<RD,ID:21:"Sub-Heading 1"><JD:"Intro-Benefits of Folio 4-Commercial Information Publishers">Commercial Information Publishers
<RD,ID:22><BD->If you sell the information you create or compile, then you need Folio Publisher.<BD>
<RD,ID:23><BD->Folio Publisher product includes the software commercial information providers need to deliver their electronic reference information to end users. Folio Publisher includes a special license agreement for distribution of Folio software, a tool to prepare infobases for commercial distribution, and the Folio Views application with a special search engine for commercial applications designed only to open commercial infobases. Available for 32-bit Windows operating systems.<BD>
<RD,ID:24>Folio also provides the Folio Integrator, a complete software development kit for Folio Technology. The Folio Integrator gives application developers access to the same controls and APIs used by Folio to develop the Folio Views client software. The application developers may then use the controls and APIs to develop their own custom applications which take advantage of the powerful Folio infobase search engine. See <JL:Jump,"Intro-Other Folio Products & Services">Other Folio Products & Services<EL> for more information.
<RD,ID:25:Heading><JD:"Intro-Infobase: A Definition">Infobase: A Definition
<RD,ID:26>An infobase is a single-file electronic repository for large volumes of dynamic reference information that is primarily free-format or semi-structured and not well suited for traditional databases.
<RD,ID:27>Infobases store text and multimedia information which is highly compressed, and full-text indexed. In addition to instantaneous searching, sophisticated hypertext linking, topical grouping, and automatically generated tables of contents.
<RD,ID:28>Placing information into a Folio infobase actually adds value to that information. Because every word in an infobase is automatically indexed, any piece of information can be found in an instant using the infobase's powerful search engine.
<RD,ID:29>Using Folio infobases, work groups can access and adapt information in ways that make it more valuable to them. Corporations, work groups and individual users all benefit from Folio's unique ability to index and retrieve information rapidly, store and display multimedia objects, link information together, update information on-the-fly and present a variety of contexts large collections of information may be viewed.
<RD,ID:2A>So, put your information — documents, manuals, reports, guides, lists, tables, tips, memos, and just about anything and everything else — into an infobase. Once it's there, everything you need to know, you'll find right there, in your infobase.
<RD,ID:2B:Heading><JD:"Intro-Getting Started with Folio 4">Getting Started With Folio
<RD,ID:2C>The reference sections in this infobase are designed to help you accomplish specific tasks using the Folio products. However, it is often difficult to know where to begin or what is possible with a new software product. To help you get started as smoothly as possible, Folio has provided the following resources:
<RD,ID:2D>The <CS:Emphasis><JL:Jump,"Main menu heading","Getstrt4.nfo">Getting Started Manual</CS><EL> provides basic instructions on using Folio Views and can serve as a quick reference for many tasks. The Getting Started manual is available in both printed and infobase formats.
<RD,ID:2E>The <CS:Emphasis><QL:Query,"[Group 'how do i']",RH>How Do I?</CS><EL> task list provides quick access to many procedures for accomplishing different tasks. The How Do I? list is accessed by choosing <CS:"Screen Items">How Do I</CS> from the <CS:"Screen Items">Help</CS> menu and then clicking on How Do I?
<RD,ID:2F>The <CS:Emphasis><QL:Query,"[Group contents] Or[Group contents-reference overviews]",RH>Application Overviews</CS><EL> at the start of each reference section in this infobase give basic information on how to use the application or component discussed in that reference. For example, the overview for the <QL:Query,"[Contents 'Folio Views Reference','Overview of Folio Views']",RH>Folio Views<EL> reference discusses some of the basic principles and tasks necessary for using Folio Views. These overviews are the best place to start in order to understand a specific application or component in the Folio product line.
<RD,ID:30:"Sub-Heading 1">Getting Around in This Infobase
<RD,ID:31>There are several methods you may use to get around in this (or any) infobase. The most common are:<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Use the scroll bars to scan through the infobase.<HR><PS:"List 2"><FD:"New to 4.2">•<TB>Use the mouse wheel on an IntelliMouse to scroll through the infobase.</FD:"New to 4.2"><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Click on colored, underlined text to jump to a related section.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Click on a heading in the Table of Contents (on the left side of the screen) to go to that section.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Choose <CS:"Screen Items">Query</CS> from the <CS:"Screen Items">Search</CS> menu and type the keywords you need to find.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Use the query templates (listed under the <CS:"Screen Items">Search</CS> menu) to help you find information.

<RD,ID:34><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">In addition to the primary Folio product line, Folio offers the following products and services from which you may benefit:
<RD,ID:35:Heading><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Folio Integrator
<RD,ID:36><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">The Folio Integrator (a software developers kit) provides controls and APIs which enable you to create your own infobase applications (InfoApps) and filters.
<RD,ID:37><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Several layers in the API set allow you to create applications that look similar to Folio Views with minimal effort, to use portions of Folio Views in a custom application (such as the table of contents window or the document window), or to create your own interface for accessing and displaying infobases.
<RD,ID:38><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">The Filter API allows you to create custom filters for importing and exporting file formats not directly supported by Fast Search & Transfer. It also allows you to create a chain filter that piggy-backs on an existing filter — if you want to enhance Folio's MS Word filter, you can create a chain filter that handles the enhanced conversion without having to completely recreate the MS Word filter.
<RD,ID:39><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">The Object Handler API allows you to create custom object handlers to display and manipulate data types. Object handlers could be created to play sound in an infobase (without relying on OLE), play CD-ROMS directly through an infobase, store miscellaneous files in the infobase, or handle a graphic type not directly supported by Folio (such as a full-featured CAD viewer).
<RD,ID:3A><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">The Extension API allows you to add your own menus and toolbars to the Folio Views interface. The extension both specifies the items to add and provides all support necessary for the items.

<RD,ID:6A><GR:overview>Folio Views generates a table of contents for infobases based on key formatting features. The table of contents appears on the left side of the screen in the Browse and All views, allowing you to view both the table of contents and the document at the same time.
<RD,ID:6B><GR:overview>Using the table of contents, you may quickly browse for information. Scrolling through the main headings in the table of contents gives you an idea of the type of information contained in the infobase.

<RD,ID:70><GR:overview><CS:Emphasis>Highlighters</CS> allow you to mark passages in the infobase you want to remember. Just as you may have used a highlight pen in school to mark up your books, so can you use an electronic highlighter to mark up infobases. Electronic highlighters, however, have several distinct advantages over their paper-based counterparts: they may be named for easy reference, searched to find specific information you have marked, and formatted with any of the standard character attributes available in an infobase (including foreground and background colors, fonts, and effects).
<RD,ID:71><GR:overview><CS:Emphasis>Bookmarks</CS> allow you to pinpoint locations in an infobase you may want to return to later.

Research has shown that using information (rather than just viewing information) provides higher learning and retention rates. With an infobase stored on CD-ROM, you can only access information, not use it. Shadow files allow you to make annotations to an infobase on CD-ROM and assist you in learning and remembering the information you use. Through a shadow file, you can add notes, highlighters, links, bookmarks, and other information to an infobase stored on CD. The information you add is placed in the shadow file, which is usually stored on your hard drive or on a network drive.

<RD,ID:16F><GR:"File Open"><GR:"open file"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Shadow files need to be reconciled when the infobase they are shadowing is changed.
<RD,ID:170><GR:"File Open"><GR:"open file"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Shadow files store your personalizations to an infobase. When you open a shadow file, the shadow file overlays the master infobase to which it belongs and displays the changes you have made. However, if a record you have changed in the shadow file is then changed in the master infobase, the shadow file cannot overlay the changed master — it doesn't know how to properly overlay the new or deleted information. To resolve the problem, the shadow file must be reconciled to the master infobase.
<RD,ID:171><GR:"File Open"><GR:"open file"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">To help you understand why reconcile is needed, consider the following master infobase and shadow file:<HR><OB:FO:"Shadow File Reconcile - Ex. 1">

<RD,ID:176><GR:"File Open"><GR:"open file"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">When a shadow file is reconciled, several things happen in the background. First, everything that is changed in the shadow file from the original master infobase is fielded. Then, everything that has changed from the original master infobase to the new master infobase is fielded. Next, the fielded information is checked against the reconcile options. Finally, the appropriate fielded information is merged into the shadow file and displayed.
<RD,ID:177><GR:"File Open"><GR:"open file"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">In effect, you get a new shadow file that is a combination of the changes to the master infobase and the changes you made in the shadow file.

The term "the" is a default stop word where as "toolbar" is not.  The infobase is comprised of two records; record one with the term "toolbar" and record two with the phrase "the toolbar".  If an end user queries on the phrase "the toolbar", the hit results that occur appear to be incorrect.  Folio will only find and highlight records containing the word "toolbar".  The rule of thumb for any type of proximity searching on stop words is to know that the stop word is completely ignored by the search engine just as if it were not in the infobase.</FD:"New to 4.5">

<RD,ID:6E9:"Sub-Heading 1"><GR:style><GR:"style dialog"><JD:"Styles-What is a Style?">What is a Style?
<RD,ID:6EA><GR:style><GR:"style dialog">A style is a set of formatting attributes that can be applied repeatedly by name. Instead of having to manually create an effect each time you want the effect applied, you can create a style for that effect and apply that style wherever it is needed. If you ever decide to change the appearance of the style, you can do so quickly simply by altering its attributes. Everywhere that the style is applied is changed immediately.
<RD,ID:6EB><GR:style><GR:"style dialog">For example, you might have several lists in your infobase. You could format each list manually to divide the list into two even columns that are one inch apart. If you ever decide that you need to make each list 1.5 inches apart, then you have to reformat each list individually. However, if you create a style for your lists, you could just change the paragraph attributes for that style to increase the spacing from 1 inch to 1.5 inches.
<RD,ID:6EC><GR:style><GR:"style dialog">While this may seem trivial on very small infobases, when you are working with several hundred records (or several million records), changing the formatting of a style is much more efficient than changing the formatting you have placed manually everywhere in an infobase.

<RD,ID:6F3><GR:style><GR:"style dialog"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Paragraph styles should be used to format large blocks of information, such as lists, warnings, notes, steps, procedures, or examples. Do not use paragraph styles to format primary headings in the infobase (those which should be part of the table of contents for the infobase (use <JL:Jump,"Styles-Suggestions for Level Styles">Level Styles<EL> for those headings). Paragraph styles affect entire paragraphs and may include character formatting options. Many of the guidelines for designing character styles also applies to designing paragraph styles. In addition to the guidelines for character styles, keep the following in mind:
<RD,ID:6F4><GR:style><GR:"style dialog"><PS:"List 1"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">•<TB>Use indents to create hanging indents (such as those used in this bulleted list), first line indents (such as those used in most books to start a paragraph), and to help emphasize various pieces of information.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Use paragraph spacing to separate paragraphs (rather than additional record breaks, paragraph breaks, or line break). Most infobase designers prefer before paragraph spacing; some use both before and after paragraph spacing. Remember that these values are additive (the distance between two paragraphs is equal to the after spacing on one plus the before spacing on the other).<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Creative use of borders can help emphasize important information. Varying the thickness and color of the borders, as well as which sides of the paragraph are bordered, can help users distinguish between different types of information (such as notes or warnings).<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Use fixed paragraph widths sparingly. Fixed paragraph widths are most effective when used with borders (to keep the border from extending across the screen).<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Avoid heavy borders or brightly colored borders. Soft colors are easier on the eye to read.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Avoid full justified or right justified text and use center justification with care. Western European languages (including English) read from left to right and top to bottom. Information that is centered or right justified is often harder to find on the screen. Information that is fully justified is often difficult to read — especially as the screen is resized.

Most fields do not use character formatting options; because a large, complex infobase may have hundreds of different fields, creating a unique look for each field is difficult. Generally, it is best to leave color for highlighters in the infobase.
<RD,ID:775><GR:"field dialog"><GR:field><GR:"new field dialog">However, some key fields in your infobase may need different character attributes assigned to them.

<RD,ID:776><GR:"field dialog"><GR:field><GR:"new field dialog">Some infobase designers use the Hidden attribute with some fields to hide text from the casual user.

All data in a specific field is normalized to simplify queries. Rather than requiring you to search for both January 1, 2000 and 1/1/00, you can search for a single format and find both.

A default field format is assigned when you create one of these fields; you may change the format at any time.
<RD,ID:77B><GR:"field dialog"><GR:field><GR:"new field dialog">The field format defines how the contents of a field appears in the Advanced Query dialog. Dates, times, and numbers can exist in different formats in the same infobase (such as January 12, 2000 or 01-12-00 or 12 JAN 2000). Creating a query to find all the different formats would be difficult without field formats. The field format causes Folio Views to internally convert the contents of a field to the same format.

<RD,ID:A18:"Sub-Heading 1"><GR:"help infobase"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Suggestions for Creating Infobase-Specific Help
<RD,ID:A19><GR:"help infobase"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Every infobase you create for others to use should have help information stored within it. The help information does not need to explain how to use Folio Views — that is what this infobase is for. It should, however, explain the purpose of the infobase and provide any tips or tricks for using the infobase. Suggested topics you may want to include in your infobase-specific help are:<HR><CS:Emphasis>Query Templates</CS> — If your infobase uses any custom query templates, you should provide general instructions on using them. These instructions should include a statement of purpose for the query template. The statement should help other users understand what the template is used for and how they can best use it to find the information that they need.
<RD,ID:A1A><GR:"help infobase"><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Fields & Groups</CS> — If you have taken the time to add fields or groups to simplify finding information and have not created query templates which take advantage of them, then you should tell other users that these fields exist and summarize the information (or type of information) which they contain. For example, if your infobase provides a comparison of computer systems, you might create fields for the amount of RAM in the system, the size of the hard drive, the speed of the hard drive, the processor speed, and other key information. If the user knows that these fields exist, they may be able to reduce the amount of time it takes them to find what they are looking for.
<RD,ID:A1B><GR:"help infobase"><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Links</CS> — If you use links for special purposes, or if you use non-standard styles for your links, provide a brief description of the types of links you are using and what they look like. For example, if you are using popup links to define terms in the infobase and are using a different link style for the definitions, you should tell the user what you are doing.
<RD,ID:A1C><GR:"help infobase"><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Special Objects</CS> — If you use objects as buttons (jump links), to provide navigational clues, or for warnings, tips, or suggestions, then you should define what those objects look like and what type of information the user should expect around those objects. For example, if you have a warning icon, you should explain how important the warnings are (if the warnings are not heeded, will they place themselves in danger, or will they simply not be as efficient in completing the task?)
<RD,ID:A1D><GR:"help infobase"><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Structure</CS> — If your infobase is highly structured, you might provide an overview of that structure to assist your users in navigating the table of contents or searching the infobase. Providing a summary of the type of information they might find at each level can assist them in knowing how far they need to expand the table of contents to get to key information.
<RD,ID:A1E><GR:"help infobase"><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Support or Contact Information</CS> — User's of the infobase should know where to turn should they have questions about the infobase. If you are sharing your infobases with friends, you should give them your phone number or address. If you are distributing the infobase for your department, then you should provide contact information so others within the department can receive help (they might need to call you, or your firm may have an internal support services group to handle questions). If you are distributing the infobase commercially, you need to provide the name, phone number, and address of your company.

<RD,ID:A46>The Folio Rights Browser is a utility for viewing infobase security options, including how long an infobase may be used, who may use the infobase, and what users may do in the infobase once it is open.

<RD,ID:A48:Heading><JD:"RB-Overview-The Rights Management Model">The Rights Management Model
<RD,ID:A49>Infobase rights are stored in a License Collection File (LCF). Within the LCF are one or more licenses, each of which may contain one or more infobases. Rights are assigned to a license; the infobases in that license have the rights defined by that license.
<RD,ID:A4A>The infobase stores a reference to the LCF. When you try to open an infobase, it checks to see if the LCF exists. If it does, it then checks to see which license it belongs to and then uses those rights.
<RD,ID:A4B>The infobase and the LCF communicate with each other. If one cannot find the other, or if one detects that the other has been tampered with, the infobase won't open. The following are possible reasons an infobase would not open:<HR><PS:"List 2">• LCF does not exist.<HR><PS:"List 2">• The license does not exist in the LCF.<HR><PS:"List 2">• The LCF has been copied or moved.<HR><PS:"List 2">• The system clock has been tampered with.<HR><PS:"List 2">• The infobase has been copied or moved.

<RD,ID:B24:"Sub-Heading 1"><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A Historical Perspective
<RD,ID:B25><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Folio Workbench is designed to replace batch processes of the past. Those who have worked to automate the infobase production process with earlier versions of Folio software will appreciate this. A typical build process in the past, running from a batch file or a macro, might perform the following steps:<HR><PS:"List 2">1.<TB>Create a temporary infobase from several source files of different formats<HR><PS:"List 2">2.<TB>Export the infobase to Folio flat file.<HR><PS:"List 2">3.<TB>Run a series of FSR, OmniMark, Awk, or Perl scripts on the flat file to add links, reformat text, apply fields, add groups, and perform other data-prep work.<HR><PS:"List 2">4.<TB>Validate the flat file to check for syntax errors.<HR><PS:"List 2">5<TB>Re-build the infobase from flat file.
<RD,ID:B26><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Simple build processes started and stopped with the first step. Major production processes implemented all of these steps — and sometimes many others — in their efforts to get their infobases created cleanly, quickly, and with as little human intervention as possible.
<RD,ID:B27:"Sub-Heading 1"><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Reality
<RD,ID:B28><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Using the Folio Workbench, you can define one or more custom <CS:Emphasis>Build Processes</CS>. Build processes replace the convoluted batch processing of the past (although die-hards can still use command line utilities with their batch processes).
<RD,ID:B29><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A build process contains a series of <CS:Emphasis>steps</CS> that the source files are moved through to create a finished infobase. A simple build process will contain a single step: Create. The source files are created into an infobase. End of story.
<RD,ID:B2A><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A more sophisticated build process may contain a convert step, which converts the source files directly to flat file, a create step which uses a <CS:Emphasis>logical filter</CS> to manipulate the flat file before the infobase is built, and a validate step to verify that everything went according to plan.
<RD,ID:B2B><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">No matter how sophisticated the build process, or how many steps are included in the process, once it is defined, anyone — from your five year old child to the president of your firm — can run the build on a set of source files simply by clicking a single button in the Workbench.
<RD,ID:B2C><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Of course, when you are prototyping, you may not want to run a full build process. You will just want to run a single step in the build process. Using the stand-alone utilities included in the Workbench, you can do this as well.
<RD,ID:B2D:"Sub-Heading 1"><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Terminology
<RD,ID:B2E><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">There are some new terms that come with the Folio Workbench. Some of them were mentioned in the last section — build, step, and logical filter. There are some other terms you will also need to be familiar with as you use the Workbench.
<RD,ID:B2F><GR:"wb-help overview"><GR:"overview of the workbench"><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Build</CS> — Defines the steps that the source files are moved through in the process of becoming an infobase (from <IT+>Zen & The Art of Infobase Creation<IT>).<HR><CS:Emphasis>Step</CS> — A single, configurable process to run on the source files. Five types of steps may be used in a build process: Validate (source files), Convert, Create, Validate (infobase), and Confirm. Two other types of steps may be used with the stand-alone utilities: Extract and Optimize.<HR><CS:Emphasis>Filter</CS> — A process which translates data from one format to another. The Workbench includes filters for working with several popular formats, including MS Word, WordPerfect, and RTF, as well as the standard Folio flat file. Most of the filters may be configured to handle different options; if you use the same options repeatedly, you can create a "new" filter which remembers those options.<HR><CS:Emphasis>Logical Filter</CS> — A filter which combines one of the standard filters provided with the Workbench with one or more scripts (such as FSR, Perl, OmniMark, or Awk). The logical filter runs the scripts and then runs the output from the scripts through the standard filter.

<RD,ID:B79><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">You must have enough disk space to hold your source files. This, hopefully, is obvious.
<RD,ID:B7A><GR:"overview of the workbench"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">You must have a similar amount of disk space to hold the finished infobase (even though the finished infobase may be smaller than your source files, you need some space for temporary files created while the infobase is being created and compressed).

<RD,ID:B90><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A chain filter, like a transform, creates a logical filter. Unlike a transform, which is simply a command line utility, a chain filter is a compiled DLL created using the Folio Filter API (part of the Folio Integrator).

There are typically two code pages active, the ANSI code page and the OEM code page.  When executing commands from the command line, the ANSI code page will be in use but when executing batch files the OEM code page will be in use.

<RD,ID:D7A><GR:"wb-optimize tool"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Use Optimize to compress the infobase. Create does some compression on the infobase; Optimize puts the finishing touches on it.
<RD,ID:D7B><GR:"wb-optimize tool"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Also use optimize to periodically re-compress infobases that are heavily edited or annotated. Doing so will reduce the size of the infobase and make it more efficient.
<RD,ID:D7C><GR:"wb-optimize tool"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Create utility in Folio Views 3.x did both the indexing and the compression on infobases. In Folio 4.x, Create does the indexing and Optimize does the compression. These two processes are separated to save time during the initial builds (by not compressing your prototypes, you can save several minutes or even hours depending on the size of your infobases).
<RD,ID:D7D><GR:"wb-optimize tool"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Note that Optimize generates a new infobase file. You need enough disk space to store the original file and the optimized file. Depending on the size of your hard drive, you may need to set the output for Optimize to a secondary or network drive.

<RD,ID:DB0><GR:"wb-configure build"><GR:"wb-configure builds"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Workbench comes with three standard build processes. The basic structure of these builds are adequate for most infobase authors — the most you should need to do is set the options for the build to make sure it does what you want it to.
<RD,ID:DB1><GR:"wb-configure build"><GR:"wb-configure builds"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The three default builds are:<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Initial Build</CS> — Creates an infobase from the source files. This is often useful for early prototypes to see what other conversion work needs to be done.<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Conversion Build</CS> — Converts the source files to flat file and then creates an infobase. (By configuring a filter, you can add a transform that runs before the flat file is created to an infobase. The transform – such as an OmniMark or Perl script – can perform additional data manipulation on the flat file.)<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Final Build</CS> — Adds Confirm to the Conversion build. Use this as your final build before distributing the infobase.

<RD,ID:DEF><GR:"wb-configure filters"><GR:"wb-configure filter"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A Chain Filter hooks into the standard filter DLL to provide additional processing of information as the infobase is being created.

<RD,ID:DFB><GR:"wb-configure filters"><GR:"wb-configure filter"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Folio Workbench comes with three chain filters you can use to enhance the functionality of the filters.

<RD,ID:DFE><GR:"wb-configure filters"><GR:"wb-configure filter"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A chain filter is a DLL that is used in conjunction with an import or export filter. The chain filter can alter the conversion that the import or export filter performs.
<RD,ID:DFF><GR:"wb-configure filters"><GR:"wb-configure filter"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For example, you can write a chain filter to alter the conversion of the Folio's WordPerfect filter. The chain filter might intercept and remove all absolute formatting attributes. It might convert a given style application to a group. There are endless possibilities. Writing a chain filter is an attractive alternative to re-writing an entire filter in order to make small modifications to the conversion it performs.
<RD,ID:E00><GR:"wb-configure filters"><GR:"wb-configure filter"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A chain filter acts as a funnel through which filter tokens pass. When a chain filter gets handed a filter token it can pass it on unchanged, remove it from the token stream, replace it, buffer it up to send later, or do anything else with it. It can also add tokens to the token stream.
<RD,ID:E01><GR:"wb-configure filters"><GR:"wb-configure filter"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">To create a chain filter, you must use the Folio Integrator (a software developers kit) and be able to create a Windows DLL using C or C++.

<RD,ID:EDC:Heading><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">What is the Query Template Editor?
<RD,ID:EDD><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Query Template Editor is a graphical dialog editor for creating custom query dialogs for use with an infobase. These custom query dialogs (query templates) may be used to hide some of the complexity of the Folio Views query syntax from infobase users or to guide them through the process of creating a query.
<RD,ID:EDE><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For example, you might use a query template to help a user locate fielded information in an infobase. Or you might use one to identify the sections of the infobase to search for a set of terms. The query templates you create will depend on the structure of the infobase you are searching and on the skill level of other users with whom you will be sharing the infobase.
<RD,ID:EDF><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A query template is basically a mask for the Folio Views query syntax. The template provides areas where users can enter terms to search for; the information provided by the user is then plugged into a query string that you, as the creator of the query template, must provide. As the creator of the template, you must be familiar with the query syntax. For more information on the Folio Views query syntax, see <JL:Jump,"FV-Advanced Query">Advanced Query<EL>.

<RD,ID:EFB:Heading><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)"><JD:"QTE Overview-Creating the query string">Creating the Query String
<RD,ID:EFC><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Each query template has a query string associated with it. The query string is a set of recognized control codes. These codes tell Folio Views what to do with the text in the edit boxes and what to do if an edit box is left empty.
<RD,ID:EFD><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Creating the basic part of the string is fairly straightforward. You build a query as you normally would, using the standard Folio Views query syntax. In every place you might use a term, you insert the contents of one or more of the edit box controls. To insert the contents of the edit controls, you use a variable. The variables are numbered: they range from #E1 to #E32 (if you had 32 edit controls in the template).
<RD,ID:EFE><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The base query string you create should work if every edit box in the template is filled in. However, since users may not add text to every edit box, you should insert special codes to tell Folio Views to ignore the variable and any associated components of the query string. The codes, called Range codes, are also numbered (from #R1 to #R32).
<RD,ID:EFF><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For example, suppose your template has three edit controls in it, called #E1, #E2 and #E3, and your query string is:<HR><PS:"Example Input">#E1 and #E2 or #E3<HR>The above query simply plugs the contents of each edit box into #E1, #E2 and #E3, and then performs the query. What happens if #E2 is left blank? Views <BD+>cannot <BD>process a query that looks like:<HR><PS:"Example Input">#E1 and or #E3<HR>To solve this problem, you must specify ranges in the query string. <HR>To handle the case above, where E2 is left blank, you tell Views to ignore #E2 and one of the operators:<HR><PS:"Example Input">#E1 and #R2#E2 or#R2 #E3<HR><CS:"Example Text">#R2…#R2</CS> specifies the range of the query string that Views should ignore if #E2 (edit box number 2) is left blank. You may specify similar ranges for each edit box in the query string. (Note that ranges are paired.)<HR>Range variables are also used to identify Check buttons and Radio buttons used in the template. Check buttons use #R1xx and Radio buttons use #R2xx (in both cases xx represents an incremented number for each Check or Radio button). You can have up to 21 Check buttons and 32 Radio buttons on one template.<HR>Referencing Check and Radio buttons is similar to using Range variables with Edit boxes. The portion of the string using the Check or Radio button is surrounded by the Range variable that corresponds to the Check or Radio button.<HR>For example,<HR><CS:"Example Text">#R201[Contents Folio Views Reference] #E1 #R201 #R202[Contents Folio Views Reference] or [Contents Workbench Reference] #E1 #R202<HR></CS>#R201 is the range variable for the first Radio button in the template and #R202 is the second Radio button. The first Radio button's range variable surrounds the entire portion of the query string that is controlled by that Radio button. The second Radio button uses its corresponding range variable to specify its portion of the string.

<RD,ID:F52><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">As a tip, number your templates and use the number as the accelerator (this works for up to 9 templates).

Since the template names are listed alphabetically on the <CS:"Screen Items">Search</CS> menu, and since numbers are listed before letters, you can set up the templates to appear in the order that makes the most sense to you.

<RD,ID:1006><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Apply to All button allows you to apply the query in the template to all open infobases. A query template may only have one Apply to All button.

<RD,ID:1008><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Cancel button allows users to cancel the current query and close the template without applying the query. A query template may only have one Cancel button.
<RD,ID:1009:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Help
<RD,ID:100A><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Help button allows users to get template-specific help. The Help button requires a query string; when a user chooses the Help button, the query string is applied to the default help infobase. A query template may only have one Help button.<HR>The help button in the Query Template will always reference the help file used by Folio Views. As such, you need to include help information about your query template in the default help infobase.
<RD,ID:100B><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For the template to find the help information you add, you must specify a query to perform. Usually, a Contents query or a Group query is best (make sure the headings or groups are applied in the infobase).
<RD,ID:100C><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">You may, if you choose, use the groups Query Template 1 through Query Template 12. Doing so will provide context-sensitive help from the first 12 query templates listed on the Search menu (if the user highlights the menu items and presses F1, he or she is taken to your information). The same group could also be used for in your Help button.
<RD,ID:100D><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The drawback to using these groups is that the F1 menu help will change if the templates are reordered on the Search menu. (If template 2 is moved to the third position, the F1 help from the menu will reference the group Query Template 3, not Query Template 2). The help button should still work.
<RD,ID:100E:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Insert Text
<RD,ID:100F><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Insert Text button allows you insert the text displayed on the button. For example, you might have an Insert button that says AND. The button could then be used to add the AND operator into the query. A query template may have more than one Insert Text button.<HR>Note that the text of the button (including any query operators) is inserted into the active edit box. When the query is applied, the contents of the edit box is put in the query string and is consequently performed.
<RD,ID:1010:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Next
<RD,ID:1011><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Next button allows the user to select the move forward through the query history for the query template. A query template may only have one Next button.
<RD,ID:1012:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">OK
<RD,ID:1013><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The OK button allows a user to initiate a search in the active infobase. A query template may only have one OK button.
<RD,ID:1014:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Previous
<RD,ID:1015><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Previous button allows the user to select the move backward through the query history for the query template. A query template may only have one Previous button.

<RD,ID:1022><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The List Box Title is the label for the list box. However, the label displayed on the actual template is updated by Folio Views as the contents of the list box changes. For example, if terms in the infobase are displayed, then the title is <CS:"Example Text">Word</CS>; if fields in the infobase are displayed, the title is <CS:"Example Text">Field</CS>.

<RD,ID:1023:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Results Text
<RD,ID:1024><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Results Text shows the total number of records or partitions with hits. Generally, you do not need to change the results text; if you leave it alone, Folio Views will update the text to display records or partitions with hits. However, if you use your own text and one or more of three special metacharacter sets, you can change the display:<HR><CS:"Example Text">%1!s!</CS> is designed to display the word "Records" or "Partitions," depending on what is being displayed in the Results Map.<HR><CS:"Example Text">%2!lu!</CS> is designed to display the # of records or partitions with hits. The number is dynamic and is updated according to the number of search results.<HR><CS:"Example Text">%3!s!</CS> is designed to display the name of the partition.
<RD,ID:1025><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For example, the results text string<HR><PS:"Example Input">%1!s! with hits = %2!lu!<HR>might display<HR><PS:"Example Input">Partitions with hits = 33

<RD,ID:1044><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Radio Buttons provide users with an additional means of interacting with the template. When a Radio Button is selected, the other Radio Buttons are excluded, meaning only one Radio button per group can be selected.<HR>When you add Radio buttons to a template it is grouped with the Radio buttons immediately preceding it in the tab order. To create a new group of Radio buttons, a non-radio button control must be placed next in the tab order. Group boxes have no effect on the actual grouping of Radio buttons. When the query template is first displayed, the first Radio button in the group will be marked.<HR>For each Radio button added to the query template a corresponding Range variable (#R) is created. The assigned Range variables are numbered #R2xx, where the xx represents an incremented number. Use the Range variable to reference the Radio button in the query string.<HR>For example, if the query template included two Radio buttons, one for searching the Views Reference and one for searching both the Views and Workbench References, the query string would appear as follows:<HR><CS:"Example Text">#R201[Contents Folio Views Reference] #E1 #R201 #R202[Contents Folio Views Reference] or [Contents Workbench Reference] #E1 #R202</CS><HR>Notice that an Edit box variable must be referenced with each Radio button for the query string to work correctly. It is not possible to have a query template that contains only Radio buttons and no Edit boxes.<HR>This example includes an Edit box variable, but a template can be created with just Radio buttons and no Edit boxes.<HR><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis>Note:</CS> a sample Query Template is included in this infobase showing the use of Check Buttons and Radio Buttons.

<RD,ID:10D6><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Folio Rights Administrator is a utility for administrating licenses. Licenses control infobase rights, including who may access an infobase, what they may do once they access it, and how much information they can see within the infobase.

Most of this information is covered elsewhere in the reference; it is gathered into one point for convenience.
<RD,ID:10D8:Heading><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)"><JD:"RM-Overview-Understanding Rights Management">Understanding Rights Management
<RD,ID:10D9><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">This section will introduce you to Folio's approach to rights management and give you a sense of what you can do using the tools included with Folio.
<RD,ID:10DA:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Licenses, Infobases, & Users
<RD,ID:10DB><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Rights Administrator creates a <CS:Emphasis>License Collection File</CS> (LCF). The license collection file stores one or more licenses. The license collection file is a physical file that resides on a drive somewhere. <HR>All rights are controlled by a license. Each license controls the access rights and limit rights to one or more infobases.<HR>Once you create the license and set the rights for it, you may associate any number of infobases with it. In addition, you (or an on-site administrator) may add users to the license; doing so restricts access to the infobase to the users in the list.
<RD,ID:10DC><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A single license collection file may contain several licenses. Each license provides a different set of rights or a different set of infobases.<HR>An infobase may belong to more than one license, but can only be associated with one license collection file.
<RD,ID:10DD><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">As a publisher, you will create the license collection file. You will create the licenses and set the rights for the licenses within the LCF. You will add infobases to the licenses. You will <CS:Emphasis>not</CS>, however, set the users for the LCF. Your corporate customers will set the users; you will only set the maximum number of users for each license.
<RD,ID:10DE><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">While you can control how many users may access infobases associated with a license, you should not control who those users are. Unlike earlier versions of Folio Views, where you could set a list of users for an infobase and log in as one of those users, Folio Views 4.x uses the network user name to identify who is using the infobase. When a user attempts to open a rights managed infobase, the Folio server checks to see if that user is identified in the LCF file based on the network user name. If the user is not listed, then they are denied access.
<RD,ID:10DF><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">When you create a license collection file you have no way of knowing what those user names are. An on-site administrator will know; using a password you provide, the administrator can add the appropriate users to a license (but is unable to change anything else). For example, you might create accounting standards on CD-ROM. An accounting division of a large firm buys the CD and pays for a 20 user license. The accounting manager can serve as the administrator and add the 20 accountants who need access to the standards. No one else in the company can access the standards, even if they can see the infobases on their networks.
<RD,ID:10E0><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">In summary, an infobase may be associated with a single license collection file. A single LCF may contain several licenses, and the same infobase may belong to multiple licenses within the same LCF. A site administrator adds the users who need access to the licenses (and access to the infobases belonging to those licenses).
<RD,ID:10E1:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Access & Limit Rights
<RD,ID:10E2><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Through the Folio Rights Administrator, you can control the rights that others have when using an infobase. There are two types of rights you can control: access and limits. Access affects what a user may do or see in an infobase once the infobase is opened. Limits affects how long the infobase may be used and how many users may access the infobase at any one time.
<RD,ID:10E3><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Note that while rights management controls infobase access (opening the infobase, performing various tasks in the infobase), it does not control file access. You must use the operating system if you wish to prevent others from being able to see, move, or delete the physical infobase file.
<RD,ID:10E4><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The access rights you can control include:<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>How much of the infobase a user can see — By setting a query, you can limit the view of the infobase for a set of users to a sub-set of the infobase. You might use this to create a single infobase with all state statutes in it, but only allow users in a particular state to see the statutes for that state.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Editing rights in the infobase — You can give users rights to change anything in the infobase, you can give them rights to add notes, highlighters, or bookmarks, or you can deny them all editing rights.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Export and Copy rights — You can allow users to save the data in the infobase to another file format or copy it to the clipboard. (These rights are separate from each other, unlike the Folio 3.x model.)<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Print rights — You can allow users to print the infobase.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Shadow file rights — You can allow users to create a shadow file for the infobase. If you allow this right, then you can also set any of the previously listed rights for the shadow file. (Note that the infobase must be rights managed before the shadow file is created; the shadow file inherits the rights management settings from the infobase.)<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Whether or not the user can view the term list — If you have limited how much of the infobase a user can see, you may also want to take away the term list. The term list always shows every term in the infobase. It may frustrate a user who can see a term in the term list but who cannot search for or view that term in the infobase.
<RD,ID:10E5><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The limit rights you can control include:<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>When an infobase expires — When an infobase expires, users are not able to open the file. You may set an absolute date that an infobase will expire, set the number of days after the infobase is first used that it will expire, or set the number of hours of actual use after which the infobase will expire.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>How many users can access the infobase — You may set from 1 to 250 users.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>Where the infobase may be accessed from — If you are distributing the infobase on CD-ROM, you can prevent the CD-ROM from being shared over a network drive.
<RD,ID:10E6:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Interaction Between the Infobase & LCF
<RD,ID:10E7><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">When an infobase is rights managed, the Rights Administrator stores the file name of the LCF in the infobase. The LCF stores an encrypted key for opening the infobase. If the LCF file name changes, or if the key is missing or altered, then the infobase cannot be opened unless the infobase password is provided.
<RD,ID:10E8><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">When a rights managed infobase is opened, the following actions take place:<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>The password is checked. If the correct infobase password is provided through the Open dialog, all rights management options are completely by-passed and the infobase is opened with full rights.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>If the password is not correct, then the Folio infobase server (part of Folio Views) checks for the rights management reference. If the reference does not exist, then the infobase will not open.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>If the rights management reference does exist, then the Folio infobase server opens the LCF and checks the location stamp and clock stamp. If there is evidence that the LCF has been moved (indicating that someone is copying the LCF and attempting to override the security settings) or that the machine clock has been tampered with (indicating that someone is trying to bypass an expiration date), then the infobase does not open. <CS:Emphasis>Note that the location and clock stamps are set the first time the infobase is opened or the LCF is updated over the phone or by a script file.</CS> <FD:"New to 4.11">(Actually, these are only set if there is an expiration limit set in the LCF, such as an expiration date.)<HR><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis></FD:"New to 4.11"><FD:"New to 4.5">Note:  </CS>Use caution when mapping or substituting drives.  The path stamped in the LCF file must exactly match the path used to access the LCF file regardless of whether or not the two paths map to the same location.<HR><PS:"List 1"></FD:"New to 4.5">•<TB>If the location stamp and clock stamp are fine, then the Folio server checks for the user name in the LCF. The user name is generated from the network server where the infobase or LCF resides. If the user name does not exist, then Guest rights are used. If rights for Guest do not exist, then the infobase will not open.<HR><PS:"List 1">•<TB>If the user name or guest name exists, then the rights for that user or guest are applied to the infobase and the infobase opens with those rights applied.
<RD,ID:10E9:Heading><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)"><JD:"RM-Overview-Rights Management Scenarios">Typical Rights Management Scenarios
<RD,ID:10EA><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">While it is impossible to cover all the different ways that rights management should or could be used, there are a few key applications where rights management makes sense. Use these sample scenarios to consider what you need and want to do when rights managing your infobase collections.
<RD,ID:10EB><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The scenarios are:<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"RM-Overview-Rights Management Scenarios-Quarterly">Quarterly subscription to a complete set of reference information<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"RM-Overview-Rights Management Scenarios-Corporate">Corporate distribution of policy manuals<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"RM-Overview-Rights Management Scenarios-Commercial">Commercial distribution of a complete set of reference information, with limited access to that information based on geographical region (such as by state)<EL>
<RD,ID:10EC:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)"><JD:"RM-Overview-Rights Management Scenarios-Quarterly">Quarterly Subscription
<RD,ID:10ED><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Many publishers use rights management to enforce subscriptions to information sets. For example, a publisher might distribute a listing of law firms throughout the country on a quarterly basis. Each quarter, the infobases that were sent out expire. In order to have access to the latest data, the user would have to re-subscribe or get the latest infobase.
<RD,ID:10EE:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Data & Distribution Model
<RD,ID:10EF><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For this example, assume you are publishing a quarterly subscription to a nuclear physics journal. Each quarter, all articles accepted by the journal for publication for the entire year are sent to those whose subscriptions are current. If the subscription is not current, then the infobases expire and users are no longer granted access.
<RD,ID:10F0><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Since these are scholarly works that may be cited in other publications, you do not want to allow the user to change the text in the infobase at all. However, you do want to allow personalizations to shadow files of the infobase.
<RD,ID:10F1:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Implementation
<RD,ID:10F2><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For this example, let's assume that all users have the same rights and access to the same information. In this case, a single license in the LCF is all you need. A multiple license implementation is unwieldy and would not make much sense — you only need different licenses when you have a different set of rights to <IT+>administrate<IT>, not when you have different <IT+>users<IT>.
<RD,ID:10F3><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Within the license, you would set the following <CS:Emphasis>Access</CS> options:<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Infobase Access Rights</CS> — Clear all edit rights (Edit Everything, Highlighters, Bookmarks, Notes). Grant all other rights.<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Shadow File Access Rights</CS> — All rights except Edit Everything.
<RD,ID:10F4><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">These rights allow the user to annotate any shadow files for the infobase but do not permit the user to annotate the master infobase. For distribution, you might consider creating a shadow file for the user and have the user open the shadow file by default, rather than the infobase.
<RD,ID:10F5><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">You would also need to set the following <CS:Emphasis>Limit</CS> options:<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Expire After (date)</CS> — Forces the subscription to expire at the end of the next quarter.<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Limit To</CS> — Set the limit to one user.
<RD,ID:10F6><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">These rights force the user to get the latest information each quarter when the infobase expires. Another approach you might take is to provide 90 days of use (measured from first use of the infobase).
<RD,ID:10F7><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Finally, since the infobase is automatically expiring every quarter, you need a simple update process to get the new information to the user and update the rights.<HR>Rights can be updated with a script file; for those who are current on their subscription, you can send them a new infobase and have the install apply the script to their LCF, extending the license until the end of the next quarter.
<RD,ID:10F8:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)"><JD:"RM-Overview-Rights Management Scenarios-Corporate">Corporate Distribution
<RD,ID:10F9><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Corporations which distribute sensitive information to employees may choose to rights manage their infobases to prevent unauthorized changes and to keep the infobases from being distributed to unauthorized personnel. Items such as policy and procedure manuals, internal regulations, and corporate phone lists could fall into this category.
<RD,ID:10FA:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Data & Distribution Model
<RD,ID:10FB><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For this example, assume you are distributing a corporate policy manual for Human Resources to employees via a network. Everyone will access the same file from a shared network drive.
<RD,ID:10FC><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Since these are policies, you won't want employees changing them at will, so you will want to set Access options for the infobase. However, since the data isn't time sensitive, there is no need to set an expiration date for the infobase. Similarly, you probably don't want to limit the number of users for the infobase.
<RD,ID:10FD><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">If the infobase is intended only for a specific department within the company, you could limit the number of users and specify who those users are in the license.
<RD,ID:10FE><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The fact that the infobase is rights managed will prevent unauthorized duplication, since the LCF file will be invalidated if moved or copied and the infobase requires that the LCF be available to open the infobase.
<RD,ID:10FF:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Implementation
<RD,ID:1100><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">This is the easiest of the three examples. You need two licenses — one for everyone else in the company, and one for the people in human resources who are charged with maintaining the file (you could give them all the infobase password, but then you have to worry about changing the password if one of them leaves the department for some reason).
<RD,ID:1101><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The license for everyone should only have the Guest user in it. The license for the HR department should list every user from that department and should not include the Guest user.
<RD,ID:1102><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The HR department license should have all rights. You may choose to limit the number of users to the total number of users in the department.
<RD,ID:1103><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The everyone license should set the following <CS:Emphasis>Access</CS> options:<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Infobase Access Rights</CS> — Clear all edit rights (Edit Everything, Highlighters, Bookmarks, Notes). Grant all other rights.<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Shadow File Access Rights</CS> — All rights except Edit Everything.
<RD,ID:1104><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">These rights allow the user to annotate any shadow files for the infobase but not annotate the master infobase. This prevents users from placing comments about policies they disagree with in the infobase for all to view.
<RD,ID:1105><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">No Limit options should be set for the everyone license. The infobase does not need to expire and everyone should be allowed to access it (the maximum number of users is 250).
<RD,ID:1106:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)"><JD:"RM-Overview-Rights Management Scenarios-Commercial">Commercial Distribution, Limited Access
<RD,ID:1107><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Publishers often want to create a single infobase that has all of the related data for a subject, but sell only selected parts of that information to a user. Conversely, sometimes users don't want to buy all of the information available, since they are only going to use a small piece of the data.
<RD,ID:1108><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">With record-level security options in the Rights Administrator, you can set up a single infobase with different levels of access, including how much of the infobase a user can see.
<RD,ID:1109:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Data & Distribution Model
<RD,ID:110A><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For this example, assume you have an infobase of all the state insurance regulations, organized by state. You want to distribute the infobase to insurance offices in all the states, but only want each office to have access to their state's information. For an additional fee you would provide access to the entire collection.
<RD,ID:110B><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Since these are regulations, you should not allow the user to make changes to the infobase. You may, however, wish to provide annotation rights for the infobase.
<RD,ID:110C:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Implementation
<RD,ID:110D><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For this example, you will need 51 licenses — one for each state and one for all states (you will need more if you include Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico).
<RD,ID:110E><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For simplicity, each license should have the same name as the state. The license for all states could be <CS:"Example Text">All States</CS>.
<RD,ID:110F><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The licenses for each state will be identical except for the record-level security query.
<RD,ID:1110><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For each state, you would set the following <CS:Emphasis>Access</CS> options:<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Infobase Access Rights</CS> — Clear all edit rights (Edit Everything, Highlighters, Bookmarks, Notes).

<RD,ID:1111><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">These rights allow the user to annotate any shadow files for the infobase but not annotate the master infobase.<HR>For distribution purposes you might consider creating a shadow file for the user and have the user open the shadow file by default instead of opening the infobase.
<RD,ID:1112><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">These rights also prevent the user from seeing terms in the Advanced Query dialog. Nothing is as frustrating for a user as being able to see a term in a list but not being able to locate that word in the infobase. Denying the <CS:"Screen Items">View term list</CS> option makes the users think they are seeing the entire infobase, when in fact they are not.
<RD,ID:1113><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For each state, you would also set the following <CS:Emphasis>Limit</CS> options:<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Enable License</CS> — Turn this option OFF (clear the check box).<HR><CS:"Screen Items">Limit To</CS> — Set the limit to one user.
<RD,ID:1114><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">By disabling the license, you can control which license is activated for an office. The first thing that purchasers of your infobase must do is call you to tell you the state they want to use. You can then enable the license over the phone.
<RD,ID:1115><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Set the limit to one to begin with. If additional users at an office need to be added, you can update the rights over the phone.
<RD,ID:1116><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Unless you are working with a subscription model, there is no need to expire the infobases, so no expiration dates or times should be set.
<RD,ID:1117><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For each license, you would also need to set a custom record-level security query. If you applied a level to each of the state names, and all information about that state is located beneath the level heading, then using a Contents query is the easiest way to limit the view of the infobase. For example:<HR><CS:"Example Text">[Contents Alabama]</CS>
<RD,ID:1118><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">When you set a record-level security query the records returned from that query are all that the infobase user can see or search for in Folio Views. All other information is hidden from them.
<RD,ID:1119><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Finally, for the All States license, you need to remove the record-level security. All other options can remain the same.
<RD,ID:111A><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Note that a single user cannot access more than one state at a time, unless they purchase the All States license.

Effectively, each user could only see one state at a time; since user names are derived from the network the LCF or infobase is on, there is no way around this limitation in this release of Rights Management.

<RD,ID:128B:Chapter><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Overview of Folio Bind
<RD,ID:128C:Heading><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">What is Folio Bind?
<RD,ID:128D><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Folio Bind is a utility which places a special token in an infobase. The Folio redistributable software that infobase publishers send out with their infobases checks for this special token. If the infobase does not contain the token, then the redistributable software does not open it.
<RD,ID:128E><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">In order to bind an infobase, publishers must call to register their infobase title and get a bind password. </FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Fast Search & Transfer<FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)"> uses the registration information to help track royalty payments for the distributed software. This protects Folio's revenue stream and enables the development efforts to continue to produce better software.
<RD,ID:128F><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">This overview covers the basic process for binding an infobase and includes suggestions for some of the things you may want to do before you bind the infobase.

<RD,ID:1291><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Bind infobases just before you send them out for final distribution. Since re-creating an infobase removes the binding token (even if created from a previous master infobase), you should have a final infobase that will not be re-created (it may be re-optimized at any point).

<RD,ID:1294><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Note that you may add several infobases to be bound at the same time. However, once you have bound the files in the list, you cannot add any others without first closing and re-opening Bind.

<RD,ID:1296:Heading><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Suggestions
<RD,ID:1297><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The following suggestions may help simplify the bind process for you.
<RD,ID:1298:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Perform a Final Create
<RD,ID:1299><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Perform your final create before binding the infobase. Re-creating the infobase strips the bind token from the infobase.
<RD,ID:129A:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Perform a Final Optimize
<RD,ID:129B><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">If you have made substantial changes to the infobase since it was bound, perform a final optimize on the infobase. Optimize does not strip the bind token from the infobase, so you may run it as often as necessary to keep the infobase as compressed and as fast as possible.
<RD,ID:129C:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Apply or Verify the Security Options from the Rights Administrator
<RD,ID:129D><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">As part of the publishing process, you should ensure your infobase is password protected from incidental access (this is done during the create process) and that the access rights within the infobase are set the way you want them.
<RD,ID:129E><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Rights Administrator allows you to specify what a user may do once the infobase is opened and for how long the infobase may be used before access rights expire (see the <QL:Query,"[Group Rights Administrator Reference Intro]",RH>Rights Administrator Reference<EL> for more information).
<RD,ID:129F:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Create a Parameter File for Large Projects
<RD,ID:12A0><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Bind can save parameter files, which are simply lists of infobases in a text file. If you have large projects which are issued on a subscription or other periodic basis, creating a parameter file for Bind can save you time. Before each subscription goes out, you can load the parameter file and bind all of the infobases associated with that subscription without worrying you have missed a file.

<RD,ID:1309:Chapter><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Introduction
<RD,ID:130A><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Folio flat file is a text-based markup language which represents all of the text and features of an infobase, including styles, levels, links, and objects (graphics).
<RD,ID:130B><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Use flat file codes to mark up existing text files you wish to create an infobase from, to add features to an existing infobase that has been saved as a flat file (such as a word processor document you have imported and wish to enhance), or to update an infobase. Exporting an infobase to flat file is also the most reliable method to back up an infobase. (Save the infobase to flat file and archive it; if something happens to the infobase, you can recreate it from the flat file).
<RD,ID:130C><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">In this section, you should learn how to:<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Identify the different components of a flat file code<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Distinguish between document codes and definition codes<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Distinguish between open, paired, and three-state codes<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Identify the differences between the 3.x and 4.x flat file formats.
<RD,ID:130D><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">In addition, this section should help you answer the following questions:<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>What are the general rules you must follow when implementing flat file codes?<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Since flat file codes use open angle brackets to identify the code, how can you include an open angle bracket in the finished infobase?<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>What is the standard unit of measurement for flat file codes? What are the exceptions?<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>What is the difference between the flat file (*.FFF) and the definition file (*.DEF)? How are they related?<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>What are the new codes used in the Folio Views 4.x flat file format? What other codes have changed from the 3.x version of flat file?
<RD,ID:130E><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">This section also includes a sample flat file and definition file which contain many of the standard codes. These are provided to show you how the codes can work together to create different effects.
<RD,ID:130F><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A good way to learn the flat file codes is to create a small infobase. Use the features you want to see the codes for, and then export the infobase to flat file. You can then open the flat file in a text editor and see the codes. To get a good feel for how the codes correspond to infobase features, you could change the flat file and reimport it to see the corresponding changes to the infobase. Refer to the <QL:Query,"[Contents 'Folio Flat File Reference','Alphabetical Flat File Listing']",RH>Alphabetical Flat File Listing<EL> for specifics on each of the codes.
<RD,ID:1310><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Folio Flat File documentation is divided into three parts:<HR><PS:"List 1"><CS:Emphasis>•<TB>Overview of Folio Flat File</CS> (this section) provides a broad overview of the format as well as a sample flat file.<HR><PS:"List 1"><CS:Emphasis>•<TB>Flat File Code Index</CS> is an index of all the Folio flat file codes, listing the code IDs, the code names, and links to where the codes are discussed in greater detail.
<RD,ID:1311><PS:"List 1"><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">•<TB>Alphabetical Flat File Listing</CS> is an alphabetized list of all the codes, complete with a short definition of each code, the parameters for the code, and examples showing correct usage of the code. Where possible, cross references to related codes are provided.
<RD,ID:1312><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Note:</CS> This section is not designed to instruct you on the components of an infobase. You should already have an understanding of what an infobase is and what its various components are before building a flat file. If you do not understand the components of an infobase, please refer to the <QL:Query,"[Group folio views reference intro]",RH>Folio Views Reference<EL> in this infobase for more details.
<RD,ID:1313:Heading><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Key Definitions
<RD,ID:1314><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Below are definitions of some basic terms you should know in order to understand the information in this section.
<RD,ID:1315:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Flat File
<RD,ID:1316><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">An text-based markup language which represents a Folio infobase (similar, in some ways, to SGML and other markup languages). The use of the term flat file may refer to an entire flat file (a combination of the definition file and document file) or just to the document file (which uses the .FFF extension).
<RD,ID:1317:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Definition File
<RD,ID:1318><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The portion of a flat file which stores all style definitions, level definitions, field definitions, object definitions, and other information which affects the entire flat file.
<RD,ID:1319:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Definition Code
<RD,ID:131A><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A flat file code which may be used in the definition file.
<RD,ID:131B:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Document File
<RD,ID:131C><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The portion of the flat file which stores the text of the infobase as well as formatting codes, level codes, links, object references, and other items. The document file is often referred to as the flat file since it uses the .FFF file extension.
<RD,ID:131D:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Document Code
<RD,ID:131E><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A flat file code which may be used in the document file.
<RD,ID:131F:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Paired Code
<RD,ID:1320><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">One of the three types of document codes. A paired code has a begin code and an end code. An example of a paired code is the Character Style code. You must specify where the character style application begins and where it ends. Only the text between the begin and end codes is affected by the character style. For example:<HR><PS:"Example Input"><<CS:Emphasis>Warning!<</CS><HR><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis>Note:</CS> Paired codes begin and end in a single record. If a record break <<RD> is found before an end code, the formatting is ended. If you want paired code formatting to extend across record boundaries, you need to begin the formatting at the beginning of each record. For example:<CR><CR><TB><CS:"Example Text"><<RD><<CS:Important>Catch this!<CR><TB><<RD><<CS:Important>And this!</CS>
<RD,ID:1321:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Open Code
<RD,ID:1322><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">One of the three types of document codes. An open code has a beginning code and affects all text following the code until the end of the record or paragraph in which the code is placed. An example of an open code is a <JL:Jump,"FFF-Paragraph Style Application">paragraph style<EL>. A paragraph style affects the entire paragraph it is applied to.
<RD,ID:1323:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Three-State Code
<RD,ID:1324><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">One of the three types of document codes. A three-state code has three possible settings: ON, OFF, or DEFAULT. When a code is on, the attribute is applied. When the code is off, the attribute is cleared. When the code is default, the text returns to whatever state it was in before the attribute was turned on or off. An example of a three-state code is the bold code. It may be on <<BD+> (text following the code is bold), it may be off <<BD-> (text following the code is not bold), or it may be default <<BD> (text following the code is whatever it was before bold was turned on or off). Generally, the three-state codes appear in pairs — a starting code to turn an attribute on or off, and an ending default code to restore the previous attribute.

<RD,ID:1327:Heading><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)"><JD:"Utils-Folio Flat File-Core Concepts-Def & Doc Files">Definition (.DEF) & Document (.FFF) Files
<RD,ID:1328><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">A Folio flat file is divided into two parts: a Definition file and a Document file. The definition file contains the style, object, and field definitions for an infobase; the document file contains the text of the infobase, style applications, object references, and other infobase features. Both files are required to build an infobase.
<RD,ID:1329><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The document file (also called the flat file because it has a .FFF extension) stores a reference to one or more definition files. This reference is required to ensure that the proper styles and objects are applied when the infobase is created.
<RD,ID:132A><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Definition Include <<DI> code is used to store the reference to the definition file. This code must be the first code in the document file (.FFF file). To use two or more definition files for the same flat file, insert them one after another at the top of the document file. If the document file does not reference a definition file, both Folio Views and Create do not interpret the styles and objects you have placed in the flat file (unless you are merging the flat file with an infobase or another flat file which defines the styles).
<RD,ID:132B:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Directory Structures
<RD,ID:132C><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">When infobases are exported to the flat file format, the .DEF file and .FFF file are exported to the specified directory. Object files and query templates are exported to a subdirectory of the specified directory. A separate sub-directory for the objects and query templates is created. The name of the directory is the name of the flat file with a .OB extension.
<RD,ID:132D><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For example, if you export an infobase to a c:\flatfile directory and the name of the flat file is MYFILE, then the directory structure created is:<HR><PS:"Example Input">c:\flatfile<CR>c:\flatfile\myfile.ob</FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File">

<RD,ID:1336><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Many codes require that a name be included as one of the parameters. Names may be from 1 to 127 characters long (including spaces). Names are defined in the Definition File and are used in codes in the Document File. Names in the Document File must match names in the Definition File for the code to function correctly.

Rather than using multiple windows for displaying information in a single infobase, Folio Views now uses a single window composed of one or more panes arranged in a set of predefined views.<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>A view may contain a Document pane, Contents pane, Hit List pane, Reference pane, Object pane, or a combination of these panes. Changing the view of an infobase is as easy as clicking on a tab at the bottom of Folio Views. Within each view, you may size each pane to meet your needs.<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>This integration of information simplifies working with several infobases and their tables of contents at the same time by reducing the number of windows you have open.<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>See <<QL:Query,"[Contents folio views reference,view,'views & panes']",RH>Views><<EL> for more information on each of the default views and what each is designed for.<HR><LW:5.5><<RD:"Sub-Heading 2">Searching Enhancements<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>Finding information fast is what Folio Views does best, and this version does it better than ever. In addition to significantly speeding up phrase and proximity searches, Folio Views also supports true relevancy ranking in the Hit List and natural language queries.<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>Simple ranked queries allow you to use a natural language to search infobases (rather than the query syntax) and rank the hits in the Hit List pane.<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>A new Query toolbar allows you to quickly enter a simple ranked search at any time.<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>Of course, Boolean searches, wildcards, phrase, proximity, word stem, and synonym searches are still supported, as are searches in infobase structures (levels, fields, notes, popups, highlighters, and groups). A new Contents operator replaces the older level heading search. Phrase and proximity searches are enhanced not only to be faster, but also to support wildcards within phrase and proximity searches (<<CS:"Example Text">"work* not play$"<</CS> is now a valid search).<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>And for those people who create long and complex queries and who never thought the old Query dialog was big enough, you can now make the Advanced Query dialog bigger: just drag a corner of the dialog to make it as large as you need (limited only by the size of your screen).<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>Another enhancement is the Query Selection tool.

Single-click links move you from point to point faster than ever. Backtrack is replaced with Go Back and Go Forward — after you backtrack from a link or a query, you can go forward again. Next Partition Hit and Previous Partition Hit moves you back and forth between partitions that have hits.

All of the standard personalization features available in earlier versions of Folio Views are still available in this version, and most of them have been enhanced. In addition, a few new ones have been added.<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>Some of the enhancements include: removing the limit on the amount of data stored in notes and popups, allowing you to change the caption for notes and popups, adding an option to move a bookmark, and providing a simpler method for adding and removing groups from records.<HR><LW:5.5><<RD>Also added is a simplified method for applying highlighters to an infobase.

<RD,ID:155C><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Field Format allows you to specify how information in a specific field may be searched for in the infobase — regardless of how it appears in flat file. For example, you might have several different date formats in a Date field named "Accounts Receivable." By specifying a field format for the "Accounts Receivable" date field, you could search for ALL dates in the field with one query, rather than having to search for "1-5-94" and "Jan 5, 1994" (or any other possible variations). 
<RD,ID:155D><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">If no Field Format is specified for a particular field, then a default field format is used for the field.
<RD,ID:155E><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Field Format is one of the specified templates (see the following list) for the field types which Views uses when searching the contents of those field types.
<RD,ID:155F><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Field formats can be assigned to <JL:Jump,"FFF-Field Definition-Field Formats-Time">Time<EL>, <JL:Jump,"FFF-Field Definition-Field Formats-Date">date<EL>, <JL:Jump,"FFF-Field Definition-Field Formats-Integer">integer<EL>, and <JL:Jump,"FFF-Field Definition-Field Formats-Real Number">real<EL> fields. The field format internally reformats the information to allow easy and consistent queries across different input formats. A default field format is assigned when you create one of these fields; you may change the format at any time.
<RD,ID:1560><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The field format defines how the contents of a field appears in the Advanced Query dialog. Dates, times, and numbers can exist in different formats in the same infobase (such as January 12, 2002 or 01-12-02 or 12 JAN 2002). Creating a query to find all the different formats would be difficult without field formats. The field format causes the Folio Server to internally convert the contents of a field to the same format. This consistent format is then displayed in the Advanced Query dialog. The actual text within the infobase does not change.

<RD,ID:1573><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Indexing options allow you to specify how information in a <CS:Emphasis>text</CS> field may be searched in the finished infobase. (The indexing options extend the functionality of the IX+ and IX- options provided in the 3.1 version of flat file.)
<RD,ID:1574><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">There are basically three types of indexing options: Field Indexing, Enclosing Indexing, and No Indexing. <CS:"Example Text">Field Indexing</CS> adds the terms in the field application to the field's index. This allows the terms to be found in a field search (such as <CS:"Example Text">Field X:dog</CS>). <CS:"Example Text">Enclosing Indexing</CS> adds the terms in the field application to the infobase index. This allows the terms to be found during a normal query (such as a search for the word dog). <CS:"Example Text">No Indexing</CS> turns indexing off completely; the terms in the field application cannot be found in any search.
<RD,ID:1575><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">In addition, you may specify how terms are indexed in the Field Indexing and Field Enclosing options. Terms may be indexed as individual terms and searched as individual <CS:"Example Text">terms</CS> (this is what is described in the preceding paragraph). Terms within a field application may also be indexed as a <CS:"Example Text">phrase</CS>. When terms are indexed as a phrase, then all of the terms in the field application are considered to be one word for searching purposes. For example, if <CS:"Example Text">International Business Machines</CS> is indexed as a phrase, the single term <CS:"Example Text">International Business Machines</CS> appears in the <CS:"Screen Items">Word List</CS> in the Advanced Query dialog (rather than three separate terms).<HR><FD:"4.11-4.2 Flat File"><FD:"New to 4.2">Finally, text fields may also set a proximity for searches. If you use the Proximity (PR) option, then queries for terms in the field require that all of the terms exist in the same application of the field for a hit to register. For example, a search for [Field Presidents: Washington Adams Lincoln] would require that all three of these terms be found in the same field application. See <JL:Jump,"FFF-Field Definition-Indexing Options-Notes on PR Indexing Option">Notes on the Proximity (PR) Indexing Option<EL> for more information.</FD:"4.11-4.2 Flat File"> </FD:"New to 4.2">

This functionality gives users the ability to find terms, phrases, etc. within an application of a field proximity. Historically, field searches have been somewhat confusing to some end users. By default, the search <CS:"Example Text">[Field Name: John Doe]</CS> does not necessarily find the terms John and Doe in the same application of the field <CS:"Example Text">Name</CS>. For example, consider the following example record:<HR><PS:"Example Input"><<RD>A list of names: <<FD:Name>John Smith<</FD:Name>, <<FD:Name>Jane Doe<</FD:Name>, and <<FD:Name>John Harris<</FD:Name><HR>A normal field search for <CS:"Example Text">[Field Name: John Doe]</CS> would find a hit in this record, since the field search is actually resolved as <CS:"Example Text">[Field Name:John] & [Field Name: Doe]</CS>.<HR>With a proximity field, however, there would be no hits in this record, since the proximity requires that all terms be in the same application of the field. A search for <CS:"Example Text">[Field Name: John Smith]</CS> would result in a hit.<HR>Note that overlapping applications of the same field are treated as overlapping applications rather than nested applications.  For instance, the markup<HR><PS:"Example Input"><<RD><<FD:A>a b c<<FD:A>d e f<</FD:A>g h i<</FD:A><HR>is interpreted as an application on  a - f and another application on d - i.

<RD,ID:172F><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Object Definition codes are used to specify objects which are included in the infobase. Objects may be graphics, animation sequences, video, audio, or other non-textual information.
<RD,ID:1730><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">There are four general object classifications: Folio, Data Link, OLE, and Class.
<RD,ID:1731><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Folio objects are those which are created using the Folio Object Handler API included with the Folio Integrator (software developers kit). Default Folio object types include Bitmap, Metafile, HyperGraphic, and Picture.
<RD,ID:1732><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Data Link objects are used in Data Links only. They reference a file (such as a word processor document or spreadsheet file) that will be stored in the infobase.
<RD,ID:1733><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">OLE objects are OLE (object linking & embedding) object embedded or linked in the infobase. These can only be created on export; the files created by the export filter may be imported into an infobase through any flat file.
<RD,ID:1734><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Class objects are custom object types for any data that can be stored in the infobase. These object types must be defined and handled using the Infobase API (NFOAPI) in the Folio Integrator. A developer might use this code to embed a custom form in the infobase that is referenced by a custom extension or to embed a query template created with a better query template editor. Basically, a class object can be any type of file; how it is used in the infobase is dependent on the developer (the data link object type and the query template code used in flat file are Folio-specific implementations of this type of object).
<RD,ID:1735><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">All Folio objects require an object handler. The object handler manages the display of the object within the infobase. Additional object handlers may be created using the Object Handler API included with the Folio Integrator.
<RD,ID:1736><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Note that the bitmap and metafile object handlers attempt to autodetect file types for conversion to bitmap or metafile. If you have raster images that are not bitmap, use the Bitmap object handler to convert it in the infobase. Use the Metafile object handler for vector images. (Not all formats are supported.)
<RD,ID:1737><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis><FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Note:</CS> Folio Views 4.x does not support objects linked to a file (other than OLE objects). Object definitions which use the link to file option in 3.x flat files are converted to embedded objects. To ensure that the object is not lost, copy the files being referenced by the flat file to the same directory as the flat file.

<RD,ID:1765><FD:"4.11-4.2 Flat File"><FD:"New to 4.2"><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Paragraph proximity codes mark regions of text in an infobase which may be searched using the Paragraph Proximity query syntax. With paragraph proximity searches, all of the terms in the query must be found between two paragraph proximity codes to count as a hit.<HR>Proximity searches use a window metaphor. The search checks for the terms you are searching for within a specified window. If they all appear within the window, then the query reports a hit. The default window for paragraph proximity searches is the record. There are implied paragraph proximity codes at the beginning and ending of all records in the infobase. As such, you only need to insert paragraph proximity codes where you wish to create additional proximity windows. For example, if you insert a paragraph proximity code into the middle of a record, you have divided the record into two proximity windows (from the start of the record to the PP code and from the PP code to the end of the record). See the <JL:Jump,"FFF-Paragraph Proximity-Examples">examples<EL> for more information.<HR>Please note that paragraph proximity codes may appear anywhere in a paragraph (they do not necessarily need to go at the start or the end of a paragraph).<HR>See <JL:Jump,"FFF-Sentence Proximity">Sentence Proximity<EL> for related information.<HR><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis>Note:</CS> The primary purpose for the paragraph proximity codes is to allow you to create larger records in your infobase while still providing a mechanism to search smaller units of the infobase. Using fewer but larger records in your infobases can reduce the overall size of the infobase.<HR><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis>Note:</CS> This code is designed for use with Folio Views 4.2 and later. Versions of Folio Views 4 prior to version 4.2 can open infobases which use this code. However, the text in the infobase may display incorrectly and search results may be erroneous. As an infobase creator, it is your responsibility to ensure that your users have upgraded their software in order to use this feature.

<RD,ID:17FC><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Infobases are built around the record structure. Queries return records with hits. Groups are collections of records. And Levels are hierarchical organizations of records. Without records, an infobase would be useless.
<RD,ID:17FD><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">With that in mind, the Record code indicates the start of a new record, which may contain one or more paragraphs. Generally, a record should contain the smallest amount of usable information possible — which is usually a paragraph.
<RD,ID:17FE><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Record <<RD> code must be placed anywhere you want to start a new record. When a new record is specified, a new paragraph is created as well. The Record code, if used, MUST be used before any other text or formatting codes in the record.
<RD,ID:17FF><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Generally, you do not need to worry about the record ID until you are ready to re-create an infobase. When you re-create, set the option in the flat file export filter configuration dialog to export the persistent record IDs (select <CS:"Screen Items">Write Record IDs</CS>). These IDs are then included automatically in your flat file. (The <CS:"Screen Items">Folio Flat File with IDs</CS> filter uses this option.)
<RD,ID:1800><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">When you add new records to the flat file, you must either number them yourself or specify the previous master infobase in your Workbench project file. <FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File">(The RN code used in 3.x flat file is not supported in 4.x)</FD:"3.1 - 4.0 Flat File">. If you do not do one of these things, then it is possible to mangle the record numbers (records without IDs are assigned the next available ID, which may be used in a record that the filter hasn't encountered yet). Record numbers must be unique. (Note that you must specify the previous master in the Workbench to ensure the correct Infobase ID is transferred to the new infobase.)
<RD,ID:1801><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">You may also use record IDs to manage your information. You can create and maintain your own IDs in the flat file (rather than have the flat file filter export the IDs for you). Doing this may provide you with a method of tracking versions. For example, version one could use IDs from 0 to 100,000. Version two could use IDs from 200,000 to 300,000.

With sentence proximity searches, all of the terms in the query must be found between two sentence proximity codes to count as a hit.<HR>Proximity searches use a window metaphor. The search checks for the terms you are searching for within a specified window. If they all appear within the window, then the query reports a hit. The default window for sentence proximity searches is the record. There are implied sentence proximity codes at the beginning and ending of all records in the infobase. As such, you only need to insert sentence proximity codes where you wish to create additional proximity windows. For example, if you insert a sentence proximity code into the middle of a record, you have divided the record into two proximity windows (from the start of the record to the SE code and from the SE code to the end of the record). See the <JL:Jump,"FFF-Sentence Proximity-Examples">examples<EL> for more information.<HR>Please note that sentence proximity codes may appear anywhere in a record (they do not necessarily need to go at the start or the end of a sentence).<HR><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis>Note:</CS> This code is designed for use with Folio Views 4.2 and later.

As an infobase creator, it is your responsibility to ensure that your users have upgraded their software in order to use this feature.

Incorrect style types (i.e. — character styles being used for link styles) may cause errors when the infobase is created. 
<RD,ID:18C4><FD:"Flat File Description"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">When non-paired Character Based formatting codes (Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikeout, Hidden, Font, Point Size, and Color) are used, you may need to specify whether that attribute is to be ON, OFF, or to be unaffected (default). This is especially important for Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikeout, and Hidden. When one of these attributes is ON, it affects all text to which it is applied. When one of these attributes is OFF, it turns off that attribute entirely (even if that attribute was applied in a Level Style or a Paragraph Style). When one of these attributes is specified to be DEFAULT, then the text to which the style is applied is not affected by that attribute (i.e. — if a Paragraph Style turned Italics on before the Text Style was applied, then italics would remain on; if italics were off, they would remain off). In other words, unless specifically turned on or off, they remain in their current default state. See the following examples for further explanation.

This would allow you to include the tables in your flat files without modifying the markup of the tables.

Use TableText for the Type Name and place comma, tab, or other character-delimited data in the body of the code. Using the TableText chain filter with the Folio Flat File filter, you can create simple tables based on character delimited text. The TableText chain filter allows you to choose the character used to delimit the text for cells. Carriage-return-line-feeds (CRLFs) are used to delimit rows.

<RD,ID:1A90>The Folio Views help system uses Folio Views with a customized (and simplified) interface.
<RD,ID:1A91>This section briefly describes the help features available to you and the components of the help infobase that can assist you in finding the answers you need.
<RD,ID:1A92:Heading>Accessing Help
<RD,ID:1A93>There are four primary methods for accessing Folio Help:
<RD,ID:1A94><PS:"List 1">1.<TB>Press F1. Help on the current dialog or menu item appears.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Use this method for quick help on a specific item or to open Help before performing a search.<HR><PS:"List 1">2.<TB>Choose <CS:"Screen Items">Contents</CS> from the <CS:"Screen Items">Help</CS> menu.

Click on the Contents button to go to the contents listing, search this infobase using the query templates, or browse the infobase using the Contents pane.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Use this method when you want to take full advantage of the Folio Views interface while using the help file.
<RD,ID:1A95:Heading>Finding a Topic In Help
<RD,ID:1A96>The Help infobase is organized to help you find information several different ways.
<RD,ID:1A97>Use the <CS:Emphasis><QL:Query,"[Group contents]",RH>Contents List</CS><EL> for a high-level overview of the infobase. Follow the links in the Contents list to topics that you need assistance on.
<RD,ID:1A98>Use the <CS:Emphasis><QL:Query,"[Group contents] Or[Group contents-reference overviews]",RH>Application Overviews</CS><EL> (available from the Contents list) to quickly review the purpose and primary options of any of the included applications (such as Folio Views).
<RD,ID:1A99>Use the <CS:Emphasis><QL:Query,"[Group 'how do i']",RH>How Do I</CS><EL> list to locate information on common tasks that you may perform in Folio Views. The How Do I list is organized topically, with tasks listed beneath the topics.
<RD,ID:1A9A>Use the <CS:Emphasis>Contents pane</CS> to locate specific information on all standard menu items. Expand the heading for an item (such as the Folio Views reference) by double-clicking on the <OB:FO:"Table of Contents - Plus"> to show additional information. When you locate the information you need, double-click the heading in the table of contents to go there. View the Contents pane by choosing the <CS:"Screen Items">Browse</CS> tab or the <CS:"Screen Items">Contents</CS> tab at the bottom of the window.
<RD,ID:1A9B>Use the <CS:Emphasis>Query Templates</CS> included with the infobase to search the infobase. Query templates are custom search dialogs designed to help you focus in on the information you need. The query templates are listed at the bottom of the <CS:"Screen Items">Search</CS> menu.
<RD,ID:1A9C>Use the <CS:Emphasis>Query</CS> dialog to search the infobase. This dialog allows you to enter natural-language style queries <CS:Emphasis>without</CS> understanding the Folio Views query syntax. It has the added benefit of ranking the information that it finds in the Hit List pane (choose the <CS:"Screen Items">All</CS> tab or the <CS:"Screen Items">Hit List</CS> tab at the bottom of the window to view the Hit List). Choose <CS:"Screen Items">Query</CS> from the <CS:"Screen Items">Search</CS> menu to access this dialog.
<RD,ID:1A9D>Use the <CS:Emphasis>Advanced Query</CS> dialog to search the infobase. This dialog provides the most freedom in how you construct your searches, but requires that you understand the Folio Views query syntax. Choose <CS:"Screen Items">Advanced Query</CS> from the <CS:"Screen Items">Search</CS> menu to access this dialog.
<RD,ID:1A9E:Heading>Closing Help
<RD,ID:1A9F>To close Help, choose <CS:"Screen Items">Exit</CS> from the <CS:"Screen Items">File</CS> menu. Folio Help will close; Folio Views will remain open.
<RD,ID:1AA0:Heading><GR:"about infobase">About the Folio Views Help Infobase
<RD,ID:1AA1><GR:"about infobase">The Folio Views Help Infobase is an infobase: it may be opened in Folio Views or accessed through the Folio Help application.
<RD,ID:1AA2><GR:"about infobase">The Folio Views Help infobase provides information on the Folio products you are using. Depending on the product that you are using, you may have help information on Folio Views, the Folio Builder, and the Folio Publisher.
<RD,ID:1AA3><GR:"about infobase">The infobase is organized into "books," with each book representing a significant feature set of one of the products. If you open the Table of Contents, you will notice books for the Folio Views Help Infobase, the Folio Views Reference, and the Folio Rights Browser. There may also be other books, depending on the product which you have purchased.
<RD,ID:1AA4><GR:"about infobase">Each of the reference books are divided by main-level menu, which are in turn divided by menu item.

<RD,ID:1AA7><GR:"about infobase">The Folio Views Help Infobase assumes that you are familiar with the use of the input devices on your computer (mouse & keyboard) and with your computer operating system. It assumes that you know how to locate files, create folders (or directories), and run applications. You should be familiar with the basic terminology of the operating system.
<RD,ID:1AA8><GR:"about infobase">It does not assume that you know how to use Folio Views, although as you gain familiarity, using the help infobase will become easier.

<RD,ID:1AAD><GR:"about infobase">Typographic conventions to be aware of as you use the infobase are:<HR><CS:Emphasis>Hypertext Links</CS> — All hypertext links in the infobase use one of two styles: green underlined text or default formatting (the same as the background text). Green underlined text is used for jump links, query links, and some popup links. Some popup links (those which are used for definitions) use the default formatting. Whenever the mouse cursor passes over a link, the cursor changes to a small hand. <PW:Popup,2,1.13542,Popup><PS:"Popup/Note Windows">This is a sample popup link.<HR><PS:"Popup/Note Windows">Press <CS:Keystrokes>ESC</CS> to close.<HR><PS:"Popup/Note Windows"><LT><OB:FO:"Icon-Link Cursor"><EL><HR><CS:Emphasis>Notes & Warnings</CS> — Important information to take note of is enclosed in a thin dark red border.<HR><CS:Emphasis>Menu & Dialog Options</CS> — Information which represents menu or dialog options (such as the <CS:"Screen Items">File</CS> menu or the <CS:"Screen Items">OK</CS> button) are bold.<HR><CS:Emphasis>Keystrokes</CS> — Key combinations you press (such as <CS:Keystrokes>ENTER</CS> or <CS:Keystrokes>CTRL+N</CS>) are marked in small caps.<HR><CS:Emphasis>Procedural Steps</CS> — Procedural steps are marked in blue sans serif text.

<RD,ID:1AB0:"Sub-Heading 1"><GR:"about infobase"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">How This Infobase was Created
<RD,ID:1AB1><GR:"about infobase"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Text in the infobase was typed directly into Folio Views. Some legacy information that could be reused from earlier versions was imported via Folio Flat File.
<RD,ID:1AB2><GR:"about infobase"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Where possible, the initial structure, organization, and links were created automatically via the FSR utility, Folio Flat File, and Folio Create. Global updates, when necessary, were handled via FSR.
<RD,ID:1AB3><GR:"about infobase"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">The infobase was created by a team of writers working in a multiuser environment. Each writer had tasks to accomplish and also played an editing role. Edits were done directly in the infobase, with minor grammatical corrections being done automatically by the editor and more esoteric items handled via discussion in notes and popup links. Periodically, the infobase was optimized to maintain compactness.
<RD,ID:1AB4><GR:"about infobase"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Images in the infobase were handled by Paint Shop Pro (PSP), a registered shareware application available from <WW:Web,"www.jasc.com">JASC, Inc.<EL> Simple screen shots were created using <CS:Keystrokes>ALT+PRINT SCRN</CS> (this key combination captures the active window or dialog and sends it to the clipboard). These images were then pasted into PSP, reduced to 16-colors, saved to a file, and imported into the infobase.
<RD,ID:1AB5><GR:"about infobase"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Images with complex call outs (labels) were pasted into <WW:Web,"www.adobe.com">FrameMaker 5.0<EL> for Windows, labeled, and then captured using PSP. Simpler callouts were handled in PSP.
<RD,ID:1AB6><GR:"about infobase"><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">All printed manuals accompanying this infobase originated in infobase format and were exported to FrameMaker MIF format and imported into FrameMaker 5.0 using a custom export filter.
<RD,ID:1AB7><GR:"about infobase"><AP:0.5><FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">Moral: Folio Views is not only a great searching tool for vast quantities of electronic reference information, but also is a great writing and collaboration tool with features similar to several word processors. Use the filters to get your legacy data into an infobase, and then start using Folio Views as your primary data-entry point for text-based information.</FD:"Removed from Localized Files (complete Record)">

It does not, however, provide instructions for using some of the more interesting object handlers nor information on when you should use one object handler instead of another. This appendix does.
<RD,ID:1AD9>Within this appendix, you will find information on the following object handlers:<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-Hypergraphics">HyperGraphics (creating and editing)<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-Picture">Picture (when to use)<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-Bitmap & Metafile">Bitmap & Metafile (when to use)<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-Supported File Types">Supported File Types for HyperGraphic and Picture Objects<EL>

<RD,ID:1ADB:Heading><JD:"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-Hypergraphics">HyperGraphics
<RD,ID:1ADC>The HyperGraphic object handler allows you to create links from regions on a graphic image. Most of the standard Folio links are supported and may be intermixed on a single image (popups and end note links are not supported).
<RD,ID:1ADD>HyperGraphics are generally used for introductory screens that provide a menu to other locations in the infobase. For example, you might use an image of a resort town and create links from different locations on the image to information about those locations.
<RD,ID:1ADE>For more information about the different types of links that you may create from a hypergraphic, see <QL:Query,"[Contents 'Folio Views Reference',Tools,Links]",RH>Links<EL> in the <QL:Query,"[Group folio views reference intro]",RH>Folio Views Reference<EL>.
<RD,ID:1ADF><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis>Note:</CS> If you import a hypergraphic and then insert it several times in the infobase, each instance of the hypergraphic is identical. If you add a link to one, you add a link to all. The only way to use the same image as two different hypergraphics is to import the image twice.

<RD,ID:1AE4:Heading><JD:"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-Picture">Picture
<RD,ID:1AE5>The Picture object handler allows you to store different graphic image types in the infobase in their native format and display them in a compatible format.
<RD,ID:1AE6>Folio Views is only capable of displaying Windows Bitmap and Windows Metafile images. All other graphic image types (such as CGM or JPEG) are converted in memory for display.
<RD,ID:1AE7:Heading><JD:"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-Bitmap & Metafile">Bitmap & Metafile
<RD,ID:1AE8>The Bitmap object handler displays Windows Bitmap images only. The Metafile object handler displays Windows Metafile images only. If your infobase only uses bitmaps and metafiles and you plan on distributing your infobase to others, use this object handler and the Metafile object handler rather than the Picture object handler. The Picture object handler relies on a set of filters that must be included with the infobase for the objects to display correctly, which may complicate the distribution of your infobase application.
<RD,ID:1AE9>Both the bitmap and metafile object handlers can perform conversions (raster to bitmap, vector to metafile). It uses the filters provided with the picture and hypergraphics object handlers. If you are distributing an infobase application (including the software), but not the graphic filters, then your users will not be able to convert any files.
<RD,ID:1AEA:Heading><JD:"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-OLE">OLE
<RD,ID:1AEB>OLE is not handled through an object handler. However, since it is a type of object supported by Folio Views, it is discussed briefly here.
<RD,ID:1AEC>OLE objects allow you to store dynamic images or documents within an infobase. An embedded OLE object may be edited in its native application simply by double-clicking on it. A linked OLE object is actually a reference to a file stored outside of the infobase. If the file is modified, it is updated automatically in the infobase.
<RD,ID:1AED>To add an OLE object (either linked or embedded) to an infobase, see <QL:Query,"[Contents 'Folio Views Reference',Insert,ole object]",RH>OLE Object<EL> and <JL:Jump,"FV-clipboard functions">Paste Special<EL>.
<RD,ID:1AEE:Heading><JD:"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-Custom Object Handlers">Custom Objects
<RD,ID:1AEF>Some infobase applications may be distributed with other object handlers. These object handlers were created using the Folio Integrator but were not created by Fast Search & Transfer. If you have questions about using these object handlers or working with the object type that they support, please contact the person or organization which distributed the infobase application.
<RD,ID:1AF0>For more information on acquiring the Folio Integrator, please contact sales at sales@fastsearch.com, 1.888.871.3839 or contact one of our FAST partners.
<RD,ID:1AF1:Heading><JD:"Appendix XX-Using the Object Handlers-Supported File Types">Supported File Types
<RD,ID:1AF2>The HyperGraphic and Picture objects rely on the same core technology for displaying various graphic formats. The types of graphics (file types) supported through the HyperGraphic and Picture object handlers are listed below.<HR><PS:Note><CS:Emphasis>Note:</CS> These file types are also used for importing objects as bitmaps or metafiles or exporting objects to a different file type.
<RD,ID:1AF3:"Sub-Heading 1">Import Formats
<RD,ID:1AF4>The import filters are used to for two purposes: first, to convert graphics to bitmap or metafile format, and second, to display non-bitmap and non-metafile objects in Folio Views.<HR>When you import a graphic as a bitmap or metafile, the object is converted to a bitmap or metafile. Once the object is in one of these formats, it does not need any additional import or export filters to display the object.<HR>When you import a graphic as a picture or a hypergraphic, the object is stored in its native format and converted for display in Folio Views. The import filter for that file type <CS:Emphasis>and</CS> either the bitmap or metafile export filter are used (depending on the source format).
<RD,ID:1AF5>For example, if you store a native .GIF file in the infobase, when that file is displayed, the Picture object handler imports that file into memory using the ibgif2.flt filter (GIF import) and exports it to a bitmap in memory using the ebbmp2.flt (BMP export).

<RD,ID:1AF7:"Sub-Heading 1">Export Formats
<RD,ID:1AF8>The export filters are used to for two purposes: first, to export graphics from the infobase to a file, and second, to display non-bitmap and non-metafile objects in Folio Views.<HR>Any image stored in the infobase may be exported to another format if the export graphic filter for that format is available.<HR>Two export filters are always used with the picture or hypergraphics object handler. The Bitmap export (ebbmp2.flt) and the Metafile export (emwmf2.flt) are used to render images stored in another format.
<RD,ID:1AF9>For example, if you store a native .GIF file in the infobase, when that file is displayed, the Picture object handler imports that file into memory using the ibgif2.flt filter (GIF import) and exports it to a bitmap in memory using the ebbmp2.flt (BMP export).

<RD,ID:1B08>Publishers might use this option to test the settings they want for their users without altering their current production version of Views. The may also choose to use this option to prevent other publishers from overwriting their configuration settings.
<RD,ID:1B09>All of the configuration settings are stored in the Windows Registry. By default, Folio Views looks in <CS:"Example Text">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Folio\4\Views</CS>. You may specify a different path to a different registry key for your custom options.
<RD,ID:1B0A>It is recommended that you use your company name or product name as part of the key to help prevent collisions with other publishers.

<RD,ID:1B0C>You may create the different configurations two different ways. You may either explicitly export the current configuration from the Windows Registry Editor or have Folio Views create a new key based on the default settings, which you can then modify.
<RD,ID:1B0D>To explicitly export your current settings, export the default Views key from the Registry Editor. Use a search and replace to change <CS:"Example Text">\FolioViewsEnu\4\Views</CS> to the path you want to use (under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software). Import the changed file into the registry editor, and you are ready to go.
<RD,ID:1B0E>To use the different configurations, create a shortcut to Views.exe and add the -c option to the command line for the shortcut (right-click the shortcut and choose Properties).
<RD,ID:1B0F>To have Folio Views automatically create a new registry key for you based on the default settings, use the -c option and specify a registry key that does not exist. Changes you make to the configuration are saved to that location when Folio Views is closed.

<RD,ID:1B1A><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Control File utility is used to specify the location of log and lock files generated by Folio Views. These files are created whenever the infobase is used in a multiuser environment.
<RD,ID:1B1B><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">By default, these files are created in the same directory as the infobase. However, this can cause problems in some cases. For example, you may choose to remove the delete rights from the directory the infobase is in to prevent accidental deletion of the file. However, doing so prevents all users from editing or personalizing (adding notes, bookmarks, etc.) the infobase.
<RD,ID:1B1C><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Using the Control File utility, you may set the path where the controls files are stored. Usually, they are placed in a sub-directory beneath the infobase. All users who use the infobase should have read, write, and delete rights to the directory.

<RD,ID:1BEE><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">You may use whitespace in the commands to separate multiple terms.
<RD,ID:1BEF><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Terms to be added or deleted are delimited by commas. Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped.
<RD,ID:1BF0><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The lexical file provided with Folio Views does not recognize multi-word synonyms. Although EditLex will allow you to associate IBM with International Business Machines, you will not find a hit on International Business machines if you perform a synonym search on IBM in Folio Views.
<RD,ID:1BF1><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">You may use any single command on the command line rather than using it in a script file. For example, the following command line is valid (note the use of quotes around the command; this allows you to use whitespace in the command line):<HR><PS:"Example Input">editlex "add:boat,synonym:tub, tug, yacht, steamer"
<RD,ID:1BF2><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The size of the supplemental stem and thesaurus files may not exceed 32k. This is a limitation of the main lexical file licensed by Fast Search & Transfer.

<RD,ID:1C17><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Many of the import and export filters provided with Folio products include a property sheet. The property sheet specifies options for the filter. Some filters have simple property sheets; others are more complex.
<RD,ID:1C18><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (partial record)">This appendix describes the property sheets for each of the filters included in the Folio Builder product. A sub-set of these filters (primarily export filters) are included in the Folio Views product. </FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (partial record)">Only the export filter options and the HTML import filter options may be accessed from Folio Views; all others require Folio Builder.
<RD,ID:1C19>Please note that this section does not detail the features supported in a file conversion process. Since the filters are constantly being improved, any attempt to document all supported features would be foolhardy. However, a chart of general formatting options which you should expect to work is included. Esoteric items from any file format (other than Folio Flat File) may or may not be supported.

For example, if you download files from a site and set the request interval to zero, you may tie up their server and prevent other users from accessing the information.

<RD,ID:1CB1:"Sub-Heading 2"><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">How It Works:
<RD,ID:1CB2><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">The Folio W2K import filter imports W2K documents into a Folio 4 infobase.  The filter reads the document and provides the document data to the Folio 4 engine ensuring text is indexed and document formatting is maintained.  The filter <FC:0,0,0>uses <FC>two modules, <FC:0,0,0>the <FC>Microsoft Word COM component and <FC:0,0,0>the <FC>Folio RTF filter.  The Microsoft Word COM component is used to open and convert a Word for Windows 2K document into a Microsoft RTF file which is then fed to the RTF filter for import into a Folio 4 infobase.  
<RD,ID:1CB3><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">To use this filter, you must have Microsoft Word XP, Microsoft Word 2000 or Microsoft Word 2003 installed.  Follow the same procedures that you would follow when using any of the other Folio filters.  The filter is shipped as a dynamic link library named FRW2K.DLL and named “Word XP/2000/2003” in the Windows registry after a default Folio Builder installation.  
<RD,ID:1CB4><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">You should use the name in conjunction with the /F parameter when running a Folio command line create For example,
<RD,ID:1CB5><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat"> <FT:"Courier New",FX><PT:10>create.exe “/FW2K” “WORD2KDOC.DOC” “/NWORD2KNFO.NFO”<HR><PS:Note><IN:LF:0.75,FI:-0.5><TS:0.75,NM,NO><CS:Emphasis><FT><PT>Note:<TB></CS>The /F parameter is case sensitive.

<RD,ID:1CB8><FD:"New to 4.5">A chain filter is no longer required to create the Folio Table of Contents (TOC). The Folio 4.5 RTF filter now imports Microsoft Word TOC outline information directly into the infobase. The Microsoft Word document import may report errors when the Word document has added multiple table of content entries to it's TOC for a given paragraph of data. Folio infobases do not support this type of many to one functionality allowing multiple points in the TOC to arrive at the same place in the infobase. As a result only the text of the first outline will be added to the Folio infobase TOC, all other outline texts for that paragraph will be ignored.

<RD,ID:1CBC>Implementations of the Microsoft Word COM component require the logical Word portion of the filter allow for a timeout of the "Open Document" command in case any specialized document handling input requests are required.  This timeout is also respected if the Microsoft Word 2003 engine gets into an infinite loop when attempting to save a Word document to an RTF file in preparation for import into Folio.
<RD,ID:1CBD><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">Many different W2K open document events can occur which could stop the import of other documents by issuing a Word dialog interface to deal with the special document state.  The W2K filter deals with these special document states by allowing Microsoft Word to prompt and gather information from the end user to act on the problematic document.  
<RD,ID:1CBE><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">The filter waits for a configurable number of seconds, described in the Windows registry as “W2kConversionTimeout” for the end user to resolve the specialized document handling issue.  By default this value is set to 0 indicating that the filter should wait infinitely to complete the open document request.  
<RD,ID:1CBF><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">If the user resolves the specific document issue before the timeout is reached the filter takes over the Word interface and continues importing the document as if nothing abnormal occurred.  If the timeout is reached the filter logs a timeout on open error, leaves the problematic document in its current state and creates a new instance of the Word COM object to handle any other pending import requests.  
<RD,ID:1CC0><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat"><PS:Note><IN:LF:0.75,FI:-0.5><TS:0.75,NM,NO,1,NM,NO><CS:Emphasis>Note:<TB></CS>The default timeout of 0 will wait for the user input indefinitely and stop a batch import process until the end user provides the necessary input to open the document.

</FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">When a specialized document timeout occurs the W2K filter leaves the Word document open, complete with the pending interface prompting whatever Microsoft Word decides will resolve the issue.

If no special document issues occur the Word document is converted to RTF and the import process continues.
<RD,ID:1CC3><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">The Folio RTF filter was updated in order to support version 1.7 of the Microsoft Word RTF specification.  Fast Search & Transfer did not enhance the functionality of this filter to support extended W2K document properties like tables within tables, etc. although certain known bugs were fixed in order to make the filter more stable. 
<RD,ID:1CC4>Overall, the conversion process should yield the same results as a Folio RTF import of an RTF document saved from a Word XP, Word 2000 or Word 2003 application.  Implementing the Microsoft RTF format allows for future filter modifications and enhancements using defined, maintained, and documented feature sets. 
<RD,ID:1CC5:"Sub-Heading 2"><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">Known Issues:
<RD,ID:1CC6><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">During testing Fast Search & Transfer experienced an apparent Microsoft bug when dealing with corrupt documents.  The bug occurs when the user follows a certain path through prompts that are brought up by Microsoft Word.  Upon opening a corrupt document Microsoft comes up with the following message box:
<RD,ID:1CC7><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat"><OB:FO:"Microsoft Word Document Corruption",6.00417,0.831944; SD:255,255,255>
<RD,ID:1CC8><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">If the user selects “yes” and then does anything, even simply exiting the application, Microsoft Word will hang with a 100% CPU utilization the next time the corrupt document is opened.  This hang seems to tie up the COM engine and can stop a Fast Search & Transfer import filter.  The resolution is to find the hung up Word application in the task manager and end it.
<RD,ID:1CC9><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">If, during a batch import, the W2K import filter encounters a large number documents <FC:0,0,0>that <FC>require user input, <FC:0,0,0> for example <FC>password protected documents, corrupt documents or documents bound to a particular user, it can leave multiple versions of the Microsoft Word application running, waiting for user input.  This can consume large amounts of memory until the specialized document issues have been resolved.  
<RD,ID:1CCA>During Fast Search & Transfer's testing of the Folio W2K import filter, using the Microsoft Word 2003 engine, we encountered documents that put Microsoft Word 2003's RTF export engine into an infinite loop during the export of the document to a Rich Text Format file.  You can determine when this error occurs by viewing the Microsoft Windows task manager, selecting the "Processes" property sheet and then sorting the processes by CPU and seeing that the process WINWORD is using a very high percentage of the CPU time.  This error situation can also be confirmed by simply opening the Word 2003 document you are trying to convert and  attempting to save the document as an Rich Text Format file; which should cause Microsoft Word 2003 to hang.
<RD,ID:1CCB><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">The filter makes every attempt to ensure that a visible interface is available describing the document’s issue so it can be handled by the user and re-imported but in handling some corrupt document cases the Word application does not bring up an interface and leaves an orphaned Word application around hogging system resources.  If this happens<FC:0,0,0>,<FC> just end the stray Word application through task manager to free up the resources.
<RD,ID:1CCC><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">Font names larger then 31 characters are not supported by the RTF or W2K filter.  These font names are simply cut down to 31 characters and passed to the Folio engine as an invalid font.  <FC:0,0,0>Keep <FC>the utilized font names to below 32 characters until<FC:0,0,0> further notice<FC>.
<RD,ID:1CCD><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">In many cases, there is not a one to one correspondence between Folio 4 Infobase and Microsoft Word document functionality and in other cases, the filter has just not anticipated or considered a particular feature or combination of features.  Fast Search & Transfer anticipates improving and enhancing this filter to keep pace with modern functionality.  Please report any Folio 4, RTF import filter bugs or enhancement requests to Fast Search & Transfer technical support staff immediately so we can repair bugs evaluate enhancement requests for the next Folio service patch.
<RD,ID:1CCE><FD:"New to 4.5">During Fast Search & Transfer's testing of the Folio W2K filter, using the Microsoft Word 2003 engine, we encountered documents that put Microsoft Word 2003's engine into an infinite loop during the export of the file to Rich Text Format.  You can determine when this error occurs by viewing the Microsoft task manager, selecting the "Processes" property sheet and then sorting the processes by CPU and seeing that the process WINWORD is using a high percentage of the CPU time.

Please check with Microsoft support for an update to the Word 2003 engine if you experience this problem.
<RD,ID:1CCF:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"New to 4.5">Table Differences:
<RD,ID:1CD0><FD:"New to 4.5">There are differences between the ways that the Folio 4.4 import filter and Folio 4.5 import filter handle tables. The old Rich Text Format import filter was not properly isolating RTF tables and was simply creating a new table whenever it found any difference between the cell widths of the current row of the table with the prior row of the table. This old approach created the illusion of a single table by situating multiple tables on top of one another, making it appear as though Folio tables had the ability to set cell width on a cell-by-cell basis. This approach would have worked well except for the fact that Fast Search & Transfer customers made requests to repair a bug indicating that there was no way to import vertical merging across table row boundaries. The repair of the vertical cell merging bug was not possible using the old multiple tables within a virtual table approach, since there was no way in Folio to merge cells across table boundaries. Due to this limitation, Fast Search & Transfer changed the code to isolate and create a single table in Folio for each individual table found in a Microsoft Word document.<HR>Unfortunately this new and improved architecture runs into some Folio table limitations that do not exist in Word.  For example, it is not possible in Folio, without using multiple tables, to create a single table that has a hanging row, such as the following.<HR>---------- ---------------------<CR>|   A     |      B     |      C    |<CR>--------------------------------<CR>           |     D      |      E    |<CR>           -----------------------<HR>This type of table cannot be done in Folio unless you perform some user interface tricks, like adding an artificial cell under A and removing three borders of the artificial cell to imitate a blank cell that should have never been there in the first place.  These types of user interface tricks are not described by the RTF commands contained in the Word document and would be difficult to implement. The problem would be further aggravated if the table happened to be more complex, containing vertically and horizontally merged cells, header rows and columns, etc.<HR>Folio tables do not support tables contained within tables; Microsoft Word documents do.  The RTF import filter will simply disregard all inner table formatting information and use the data portions of the table as data to the cell of the outer table that contained the inner table in the Microsoft Word document.<HR>Folio tables are also unable to created variable width cells within a single table. In Microsoft Word, you can set the cell width for any given cell in a table but the Folio API and table interface do not allow for this capability.  Instead, Folio enforces a single column width array for the entire table; change one column width and you change the column width all of the cells contained in the same column of the table. Feeling that this limitation would be just too much a drawback for anyone moving from the RTF filter version 4.4 and below to the RTF import filter version 4.5, our developers decided to implement the illusion of variable sized cells using extra horizontal merge codes in the cells of the Folio table. This approach works in most cases but can cause some unexpected results where the Microsoft Word document implements table functionality that is just not available to the current infobase format.<HR>Also be aware that tables contained in a Folio infobase are limited to 32 columns per table. This limitation can be exceeded by Word documents that contain extra wide tables, especially if the table contains variable width cells spread throughout the table. If this situation occurs, a warning should be issued from the filter and the extraneous data will be put into the cell furthest right in the table.

Most text formatting, metafile and bitmap image data import nicely, however; the filter has a harder time with some complicated tables and image placement formatting.  
<RD,ID:1CD3><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">There are also limitations to the filter’s ability to merge hard character formatting information with pre-defined style formatting information so use styles whenever it is possible to format and control the Word document’s look.  
<RD,ID:1CD4><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">Fast Search & Transfer has made every effort to perfect the RTF filter but knows that it has not accounted for all possibilities.  In order to help the end user understand absolutely what is and is not supported we’ve provided a complete listing of the supported and unsupported RTF commands below.  
<RD,ID:1CD5><GR:"Filter-Importeren-W2K-RichTextFormat">The RTF filter has not been updated in many years and Fast Search & Transfer looks forward to perfecting its import abilities.  Many of the unsupported commands appear to deal with new Word functionality and support of Unicode capabilities.

<RD,ID:20FF><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The Folio Server uses the four criteria shown in the following list to calculate the relevance weight of a hit:<HR><CS:Emphasis>Local Frequency</CS> considers that the more often a query term appears in a record, the more relevant that record is. For example, a record which contains a query term 5 times is more relevant that a record which only contains that word 2 times.
<RD,ID:2100><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Inverse Document Frequency</CS> considers that terms that are rare within the context of the entire infobase are given a higher relevancy ranking. </FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For example, assume you are searching an infobase containing 20,000 records. If your search includes two terms — <CS:"Example Text">government</CS> and <CS:"Example Text">policy</CS> — and if the term <CS:"Example Text">government</CS> is only found 5 times and the term <CS:"Example Text">policy</CS> is found 300 times, then records containing <CS:"Example Text">government</CS> are given a higher weight when determining relevancy.<FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">
<RD,ID:2101><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Document Length Comparison</CS> (Density) considers that shorter records containing an equal number of query terms are more relevant than longer records. Since the terms appear closer together in a shorter record, the chance that the record is relevant to your search is higher.
<RD,ID:2102><CS:Emphasis><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Completeness</CS> considers that records which contain more of the terms in the query are more relevant than those which contain fewer. For example, if your query contains 4 terms, a record which contains those four terms is more relevant than a record which contains only 3 of the terms.<HR>In addition to these four criteria, you can skew the significance of a term in a search by using the scalar primitive to assign the term a higher weight than other search terms. Moreover, you can optionally use the domain primitive to specify that a ranked search be performed only on records which are search hits for a specified boolean query.

<RD,ID:2219><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Basic topics are listed first. As you remove advanced functionality, you may remove information from the end of each list. The How Do I? list has three distinct divisions in concepts: the first is for users who will only browse the infobase, the second is for users who will personalize the infobase, and the last is for users who have full access to the infobase. Remove the appropriate sections, depending on the level of functionality you provide.
<RD,ID:221A:"Sub-Heading 1"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Modifying Information
<RD,ID:221B:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Menu Names
<RD,ID:221C><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">If you customize the menu names for your infobase application, you will need to update the help files to match the names. If you move an item on a menu to another menu, you will need to move that information to the appropriate location in the help infobase.
<RD,ID:221D:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Updating Links
<RD,ID:221E><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Most of the links in the Folio Views Reference are jump links. If you rename sections, it is recommended that you do so in flat file to keep from deleting the Jump Destinations at that section and invalidating the links to that section.
<RD,ID:221F:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Updating Functionality
<RD,ID:2220><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">As you limit functionality, you will need to update the information in the help files accordingly. For example, if you remove the Export rights, you need to remove any reference in the infobase to exporting information from the infobase.
<RD,ID:2221><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">There can be some subtle differences as you limit functionality, so edit the infobase carefully. Some items to watch out for are:<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Some items under the Layout menu are necessary if you allow users to format tables.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Some items under the Layout menu are necessary if you allow users to use notes, popup links, or highlighters.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>Some items under the Layout menu are necessary if you allow users to change the header or footer for printing.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>The Picture dialog is necessary if you allow users to use notes and popup links.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB>The Picture dialog is necessary if you allow users to change the header or footer for printing.
<RD,ID:2222><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">There may be other items as well, depending on what you are changing.
<RD,ID:2223:"Sub-Heading 2"><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Reference Menu Structures
<RD,ID:2224><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Several menu structures are used in the reference sections to assist the user in navigating through the infobase. If you move or rename menus in the infobase, you will need to update these menu structures. There are menu structures at the beginning of the Folio Views reference and at the beginning of each menu section (File, Edit, View, Search).
<RD,ID:2225><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The menu structures at the beginning of a reference are created using a single row table, with as many cells as there are menus.
<RD,ID:2226><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The menu structures at the beginning of each menu section are created using paragraph styles. Add or remove items from these structures as needed. You may choose to replace the styles with a table if you find that easier to maintain.
<RD,ID:2227><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">The text in all menu structures are linked (by jump links) to the appropriate section. The <CS:"Example Text">Default</CS> link style is used for these links (after you create the query link, you will need to change the link style for the link to <CS:"Example Text">Default</CS>; see <JL:Jump,"FV-styles">Styles<EL> for additional information).
<RD,ID:2228:Heading><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">Default Help Strings
<RD,ID:2229><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">When a user presses F1 in Folio Views, a query string is passed to the help application. The help application opens the help infobase and performs the query.
<RD,ID:222A><FD:"Removed from Folio Views Help (complete record)">For help to work, the following query strings must be used (query strings are listed categorically). For convenience, query links are applied to each query string for testing purposes or to see where a particular help string goes in the standard help infobase.<HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Appendix-Preparing Help Files for Commercial Distribution-Menus">Menus<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Appendix-Preparing Help Files for Commercial Distribution-Dialogs">Dialogs<EL><HR><PS:"List 2">•<TB><JL:Jump,"Appendix-Preparing Help Files for Commercial Distribution-Special Toolbar Tools">Special Toolbar Tools<EL>

<RD,ID:233B>The focus and expertise of FAST consultants lies in the design and implementation of custom electronic publishing solutions which utilize the power and flexibility of Folio infobases.

They've worked with organizations in a wide variety of industries, both domestically and internationally.

And after the project is completed, FAST Consultants can train your own staff to maintain that solution on its own. To help facilitate project execution timeliness and quality, we also have an existing channel of third-party Folio developers and consultants which offer specialized FIT expertise and have been authorized by FAST to collaborate and assist with projects.
